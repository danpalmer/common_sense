Apple just announced its latest MacBook. It’s tiny. It makes the Macbook Air look like a Dell Inspiron circa 2002. But hopefully you’re not one of those jerks that actually uses the ports on the side of your computer. This MacBook only has a single USB-C and it does everything from charging, to sending video out and transporting data.  It’s the only port on the computer meaning owners cannot charge the computer and an iPhone at the same time. It’s not possible to output video to a monitor and input data from an external drive — at least not without a hub.   This single port was likely the byproduct of Apple’s quest to make the thinnest MacBook possible. Ports take a lot of room. Thanks to their physical structure, the female jack cannot be made that much smaller.  This isn’t the first time Apple threw out industry standards. In 1998 Apple shocked the industry and didn’t include a floppy drive or serial ports in the iMac G3. Instead Apple included a CD-ROM and two USB ports. In 2008, much to the chagrin of video producers, Apple stopped including Firewire ports, a standard it created, on its computers. Apple did away with CD-ROM drives as soon as it could and completely ignored Blu-ray.     But has Apple gone too far here? A single port, one that charges the computer along with much more, forces the owner to turn to other devices to use their devices in familiar ways.  Apple doesn’t rely on the industry to dictate what should be included in its computers, consumer be damned.  Update :  Here are the cables and accessories  you’ll need for the MacBook.

The main questions covered such topics as the number and demographics of side members, side performances, recruitment and kit.   The central objective of the overall project is to distribute the findings from the survey to the morris community and the wider public, and influence the debate about morris both within and beyond morris itself. This website presents insights gathered from the data to inform the morris organisations and individual sides about the opportunities and challenges facing the morris.   The pages are arranged to tell the story of the data:    Results   A breakdown of results for every question in the Morris Census  Responses How many sides responded to the Morris Census?  Numbers How many morris dancers are there in the UK?  Age How old are morris dancers in the UK?  Gender How many morris dancers are male and female?  Recruitment How many new morris dancers have been recruited recently?  Sides What are important aspects of morris side culture?

Good morning! It's a bright and sunny day in London. Here's the tech news you need to know this Wednesday.  1.  Apple is now the number one smartphone manufacturer in the world.   In Q4 of 2014, Apple devices outsold Samsung — the previous #1 — for the first time since 2011, according to data from Gartner. Apple saw a 49% jump in Q4, compared to Samsung's almost 12% decline.  2.  Uber has acquired mapping startup deCarta.  The taxi-hailing company currently uses Google Maps to power its apps for riders and drivers. Uber is also looking into self-driving car technology.  3.  Neighbourhood-based social network Nextdoor has raised $110 million at a $1.1 billion valuation.   It's trying to build hyperlocal online networks based around real-world communities.  4.  Google's search monopoly might soon be over.  That's what Peter Thiel, a respected venture capitalist, said at Launch Festival in San Francisco. Eric Schmidt has previously admitted that  "all bets are off."  5.  Facebook's Open Computer Project (OCP) has launched its first commercial startup.  Launched in 2012, the OCP aims to revolutionise the computer hardware industry in the same way Linux changed the software industry. The launch of a commercial startup is a significant milestone.  6.  Google has delayed its Android encryption plans because they were crippling people's phones.  The company had intended to have strong encryption on by default on Android 5.0 Lollipop, but it's causing massive slowdowns.  7.  Big video game companies are giving away their game engines for free.  It means that anyone can develop games using their platforms, in return for a cut of the proceeds. Valve Software, Epic Games and Unity are all opting for this royalty model.  8.  Millions of Apple and Google customers have been left vulnerable to hackers due to a newly discovered security flaw.  It's called a "FREAK attack," and Apple is  already moving to fix it .  9.  Twitter is requiring new users who sign up through Tor to provide a phone number.  It's part of a crackdown on harassment and trolling on the social network.  10.  Amazon may be planning to launch its own wireless mobile phone service.   The prediction comes from Macquarie research after Google officially announced its own network, and is in keeping with what we know of Amazon's previous products.

Your browser is vulnerable to the FREAK attack.It can be tricked into using weak encryption if you visit a vulnerable website.We encourage you to update your browser right away.   Warning!  Your browser offers RSA_EXPORT cipher suites.It can be tricked into using weak encryption if you visit a vulnerable website.We encourage you to update your browser right away.   Good News!  Your browser appears to be safe from the FREAK attack.   Whoops!  Your browser might be incompatible with our automatic vulnerability test.If  this link loads without errors , you're vulnerable.  On Tuesday, March 3, 2015, researchers announced a new SSL/TLS vulnerability called the FREAK attack. It allows an attacker to intercept HTTPS connections between vulnerable clients and servers and force them to use weakened encryption, which the attacker can break to steal or manipulate sensitive data. This site is dedicated to tracking the impact of the attack and helping users test whether they’re vulnerable.  The FREAK attack was  discovered  by  Karthikeyan Bhargavan  at INRIA in Paris and the  miTLS team . Further disclosure was coordinated by  Matthew Green . This report is maintained by computer scientists at the University of Michigan, including  Zakir Durumeric ,  David Adrian , Ariana Mirian,  Michael Bailey , and  J. Alex Halderman . The team can be contacted at  freakattack@umich.edu .  For additional details about the attack and its implications, see  this post by Matt Green ,  this site by the discoverers ,  this Washington Post article , and  this post by Ed Felten .      Who is vulnerable?  The FREAK attack is possible when a vulnerable browser connects to a susceptible web server—a server that accepts “export-grade” encryption.  Servers  Servers that accept RSA_EXPORT cipher suites put their users at risk from the FREAK attack.Using Internet-wide scanning, we have been performing daily tests of all HTTPS servers at public IP addresses to determine whether they allow this weakened encryption. More than a third of all servers with browser-trusted certificates are at risk.       Currently Vulnerable  Change Since Mar. 3    HTTPS servers at  Alexa  Top 1 Million domain names  8.7%  down from 12.2%    HTTPS servers with browser-trusted certificates  6.5%  down from 36.7%    All HTTPS servers  11.8%  down from 26.3%      See below for a list of  vulnerable popular domains . You can test servers using the  SSL FREAK Check  tool or the Qualys SSL Labs’  SSL Server Test , which can also identify other security problems.  Clients  Update (Mar. 5):    Browsers are vulnerable to the FREAK attack because of bugs that allow an attacker to force them to use weak, export-grade encryption. One example is the OpenSSL bug described in  CVE-2015-0204 , but some other TLS libraries have similar problems. Far more browsers are vulnerable to the FREAK attack than was initially thought when the attack was announced, including:    Vulnerable Browser Status  Internet Explorer Patch available now  —  Security advisory  Chrome on Mac OS Patch available now  Chrome on Android Patch available now  Safari on Mac OS Patch available now  Safari on iOS iOS 8 Patch available now  Stock Android Browser Patch available now  Blackberry Browser  Opera on Mac OS Patch available now     You can check whether your browser is vulnerable using our  FREAK Client Test Tool .  Chrome for Windows and all modern versions of Firefox are known to be safe.  However, even if your browser is safe, certain third-party software, including some anti-virus products and adware programs, can expose you to the attack by intercepting TLS connections from the browser.  If you are using a safe browser but our client test says you’re vulnerable, this is a likely cause.  In addition to browsers, many mobile apps, embedded systems, and other software products also use TLS. These are also potentially vulnerable if they rely on unpatched libraries or offer RSA_EXPORT cipher suites.    What should I do?  If you run a server …  You should immediately disable support for TLS export cipher suites. While you’re at it, you should also disable other cipher suites that are known to be insecure and enable forward secrecy.For instructions on how to secure popular HTTPS server software, we recommend Mozilla’s  security configuration guide  and their  SSL configuration generator . We also recommend testing your configuration with the Qualys SSL Labs  SSL Server Test  tool.  If you use a browser …  Make sure you have the most recent version of your browser installed, and check for updates frequently.Updates that fix the FREAK attack should be available for all major browsers soon.  If you’re a sysadmin or developer …  Make sure any TLS libraries you use are up to date.Unpatched  OpenSSL ,  Microsoft Schannel , and Apple SecureTransport all suffer from the vulnerability. Note that these libraries are used internally by many other programs, such as  wget  and  curl . You also need to ensure that your software does not offer export cipher suites, even as a last resort, since they can be exploited even if the TLS library is patched. We have provided  tools for software developers  that may be helpful for testing.  <hr/><a name="howworks"></a><h2>How does the attack work?</h2><p>When browsers were introduced in the 1990s, it was illegal for U.S. companies to export strong cryptography, so SSL/TLS (the crypto standards used for HTTPS sites) include the ability to use deliberately weaked crypto when domestic servers communicate with exported clients. One of the restrictions was that exported software wasn&rsquo;t allowed to encrypt with RSA keys stronger than 512 bits. To work around this, the standards include key-exchange modes called EXPORT_RSA cipher suites. In the EXPORT_RSA modes, the server sends the client a temporary 512-bit RSA public key, signed with the stronger public key in its certificate. The client checks the signature and then uses the temporary RSA key to send the server a random session key that&rsquo;s used to encrypt the rest of the connection. Twenty years ago, 512-bit RSA keys were strong enough to deter casual attacks, but we can assume that NSA and other intelligence agencies could readily factor them and decrypt the connection data.</p><p>Fast-forward to today. It&rsquo;s not a problem anymore to export strong cryptography, but SSL and TLS continue to support EXPORT_RSA for compatibility with very old clients.(According to our data, more than a third of browser-trusted sites accept EXPORT_RSA modes, but only if the client doesn&rsquo;t support anything stronger.)While the standards recommend that servers should regenerate temporary RSA keys frequently, most real server implementations (like Apache and Nginx) only generate a new key when the server restarts, which means they are likely to use the same key for weeks or months.</p>As <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/03/attack-of-week-freak-or-factoring-nsa.html">Nadia Heninger has shown</a>, thanks to two decades of Moore&rsquo;s Law, factoring 512-bit RSA keys now takes about 7 hours on EC2 and costs about $100.Unforutnately, if the client and server are both willing to use EXPORT_RSA as a fallback, an attacker can force them to use it. However, if both the browser and the server are willing to accept EXPORT_RSA, an attacker can trick them both into using it.    Popular sites that are susceptible to FREAK  The following sites from the  Alexa  Top 10,000 websites permit RSA_EXPORT cipher suites, which potentially puts their users at risk from the FREAK attack. This list is current as of March 10 at 8:00 AM EST.We urge these sites to drop support for export cipher suites as soon as possible.

I say “reading”, but I really mean “looking at” – not to mention grasping, dropping, throwing, cuddling, chewing, and everything else a tiny human being likes to do. Over the last six months, though, he has begun not simply to look but also to recognise a few letters and numbers. He calls a capital Y a “yak” after a picture on the door of his room; a capital H is “hedgehog”; a capital K, “kangaroo”; and so on.  Reading, unlike speaking, is a young activity in evolutionary terms. Humans have been speaking in some form for hundreds of thousands of years; we are born with the ability to acquire speech etched into our neurones. The earliest writing, however, emerged only 6,000 years ago, and every act of reading remains a version of what my son is learning: identifying the special species of physical objects known as letters and words, using much the same neural circuits as we use to identify trees, cars, animals and telephone boxes.  It’s not only words and letters that we process as objects. Texts themselves, so far as our brains are concerned, are physical landscapes. So it shouldn’t be surprising that we respond differently to words printed on a page compared to words appearing on a screen; or that the key to understanding these differences lies in the geography of words in the world.  For her new book, Words Onscreen: The Fate of Reading in a Digital World, linguistics professor Naomi Baron conducted a survey of reading preferences among over 300 university students across the US, Japan, Slovakia and Germany. When given a choice between media ranging from printouts to smartphones, laptops, e-readers and desktops, 92% of respondents replied that it was hard copy that best allowed them to concentrate.  This isn’t a result likely to surprise many editors, or anyone else who works closely with text. While writing this article, I gathered my thoughts through a version of the same principle: having collated my notes onscreen, I printed said notes, scribbled all over the resulting printout, argued with myself in the margins, placed exclamation marks next to key points, spread out the scrawled result – and from this landscape hewed a (hopefully) coherent argument.  What exactly was going on here? Age and habit played their part. But there is also a growing scientific recognition that many of a screen’s unrivalled assets – search, boundless and bottomless capacity, links and leaps and seamless navigation – are either unhelpful or downright destructive when it comes to certain kinds of reading and writing.  Across three experiments  in 2013, researchers Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer compared the effectiveness of students taking longhand notes versus typing onto laptops. Their conclusion: the relative slowness of writing by hand demands heavier “mental lifting”, forcing students to summarise rather than to quote verbatim – in turn tending to increase conceptual understanding, application and retention.   In other words, friction is good – at least so far as the remembering brain is concerned. Moreover, the textured variety of physical writing can itself be significant. In  a 2012 study at Indiana University , psychologist Karin James tested five-year-old children who did not yet know how to read or write by asking them to reproduce a letter or shape in one of three ways: typed onto a computer, drawn onto a blank sheet, or traced over a dotted outline. When the children were drawing freehand, an MRI scan during the test showed activation across areas of the brain associated in adults with reading and writing. The other two methods showed no such activation.  Similar effects have been found in  other   tests , suggesting not only a close link between reading and writing, but that the experience of reading itself differs between letters learned through handwriting and letters learned through typing. Add to this the  help that the physical geography  of a printed page or the heft of a book can provide to memory, and you’ve got a conclusion neatly matching our embodied natures: the varied, demanding, motor-skill-activating physicality of objects tends to light up our brains brighter than the placeless, weightless scrolling of words on screens.   In many ways, this is an unfair result, effectively comparing print at its best to digital at its worst. Spreading my scrawled-upon printouts across a desk, I’m not just accessing data; I’m reviewing the idiosyncratic geography of something I created, carried and adorned. But I researched my piece online, I’m going to type it up onscreen, and my readers will enjoy an onscreen environment expressly designed to gift resonance: a geography, a context. Screens are at their worst when they ape and mourn paper. At their best, they’re something free to engage and activate our wondering minds in ways undreamt of a century ago.  Above all, it seems to me, we must abandon the notion that there is only one way of reading, or that technology and paper are engaged in some implacable war. We’re lucky enough to have both growing self-knowledge and an opportunity to make our options as fit for purpose as possible – as slippery and searchable or slow with friction as the occasion demands.   I can’t imagine teaching my son to read in a house without any physical books, pens or paper. But I can’t imagine denying him the limitless words and worlds a screen can bring to him either. I hope I can help him learn to make the most of both – and to type/copy/paste/sketch/scribble precisely as much as he needs to make each idea his own.

These leading startups join an alumni group that includes the likes of YPlan, Hassle, import.io and Glow, and has to-date raised over $36m.  In this series we took the founders on a cab ride unlike any other for the most exciting pitch of their lives.   Inside and outside the classroom, technology has revolutionised the way people learn.  For many of us, it would have started with fancy WordArt in PowerPoint presentations, but now edtech is much, much more.  Better collaboration  Despite all the advancements in educational technology, Michael Willmott still felt there was a gap technology wasn’t fixing.  Stuck on a piece of work at 1am, he realised there was no decent way to reach out into his network of peers, or even a broader network of people studying in his field. The idea behind  Knodium  grew from there.  Knodium allows anyone at university to create and join communities based on their courses, project work, study groups or even just common interests.  It’s a simple, uncluttered way to have discussions, share documents and resources and engage with others.  I realised that the way students engage with and learn from each other is moving increasingly online, yet there is an incredibly fragmented experience between the online part of a student’s education and the offline part.   Knodium’s powerful tools  Knodium has built-in tools that it believes makes the learning experience for students as effortless as possible.  Users can write complicated mathematical equations with LaTeX or even draw otherwise difficult-to-communicate chemical diagrams.  How universities benefit  The service isn’t just useful for those studying. Universities can use Knodium to gain important insights into their students – insights that previously would have been inaccessible.  Knodium started with fairly quiet trials in mid-2012 and opened up to universities across the UK in September 2013.  Willmott says the next stage for the startup is building its team and working with more universities.  One of our main aims is to support and push for big growth within our existing network of 120 universities.  We want to build something that becomes a staple part of the education experience for many students by the end of this academic year.

While Apple hasn't provided an agenda for the event, it's hard not to imagine the  Apple Watch  will be front and center. Pricing for the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Editions, along with variances for the different size and band options, details on final hardware and software features, and much more remains to be discovered. break  Whether anything else makes an appearance on stage or not remains a question. In previous years Apple's used spring events to announce new  iPads  and  Apple TV  hardware. The iPads were just updated last October and the Apple TV has been in stealth mode lately. Rumors of a  MacBook Air  update keep circulating, but could just as easily keep this event focused on the Apple Watch.  We've been waiting for this for a long time. Looks like we won't have to wait much longer!  I'll be there with Serenity Caldwell, and we'll bring  you  the experience as it happens. Apple will also be  broadcasting the Spring Forward event live  via  apple.com/live                    <div class="side-ad">                  </div>      / container columns-2          Rene Ritchie EiC of iMore, EP of Mobile Nations, Apple analyst, co-host of Debug, Iterate, Vector, Review, and MacBreak Weekly podcasts.

I wish they would also go with less expensive plug and play sticks like Roku, Chromecast, etc. so I could justify purchasing one for each kid's room.                0         2 weeks ago  Reply     / bottom-part     / comment-content     / comment                   Solamar            / top-container   My guess, they update the chips in the MBA to Broadwell only. No new 'features...   and  Will NOT announce the Retina Macbook Air. All 'rumor' points to a mid-year release on the Retina MBA because they are skipping Broadwell for the next gen Retina Macbook Air going directly to Skylake.   and honestly .. that makes complete sense.. Skylake is also slated for mid-year release, and is worth the wait IMHO to get in the first Retina Macbook Air.                0         3 weeks ago  Reply     / bottom-part     / comment-content     / comment                   iPandorum            / top-container   Finally!

Other iPods maybe.  Too bad they likely won't release Yosemite 10.10.3, though.  I find performance can use quite a bit of a boost.  It performs kind of bad compared to Windows 8.1 on worse hardware, and it's kind of driving me mad considering the "premium" I paid for a computer running it.  Not interested in the watch either.  I find it to be one of the ugliest smart watching to get released yet (not as ugly as Pebble's, but Motorola's definitely looks a ton better) and it looks hella bulky.  Just not fashionable by any stretch of the word, except for the fact that it's an "Apple" watch.  I guess that counts these days?                0         3 weeks ago  Reply     / bottom-part     / comment-content     / comment                   decypher44            / top-container   A lot of deleted comments??

Since Apple usually brings in new iPads this time of year. 12.9 inch is awfully close to 13". Some have mentioned something about a new MacBook Pro. There's even been rumors about an iOS/OS X hybrid. Other reported features too, like split screen, a stylus, speaker grills at the top and bottom, and a concept video showing an "iPad Pro" running a full version of iOS X.   For those interested in an Apple TV refresh (food-for-thought), let's combine the powerful iPad Pro with an Apple TV compatibility, with the rumored A9 chip? I'd like to see something for gaming, like "Apple Play", or "iPlay".  Anywho, some reports stated all year that early 2015 would be a release date. Then pushed back or shelved, because of the demand for the iPhone 6. Maybe between April-June.   I don't know about you guys, but I've got a feeling something different will happen.

Pebble Time is fully compatible with all 6,500+ existing Pebble apps and watchfaces.  Three colors available exclusively on Kickstarter. Pebble Time starts shipping in May. Pebble Time Steel starts shipping in July.

And don't worry, you'll still keep your original spot in line.         We're back on Kickstarter This is where it all started. Three years ago you supported our vision to make the world’s first real smartwatch. The Kickstarter community and our early adopters believed in us before anyone else even knew we existed. You blew us away with your support and kicked off a worldwide movement! With your help, we set the bar very high:      Your overwhelming support and feedback has shaped what Pebble is today. We’re back on Kickstarter to give you - the community who cares the most - an opportunity to support our vision for wearables and get exclusive access to our newest product.            Get more info at a glance...in color! At its heart, Pebble Time is an awesome watch. The new color e-paper display is easy to read and always-on, perfect for displaying incoming notifications and your favorite watchface. Compared with display technology like LCD or OLED, power consumption is minimized, enabling Pebble Time to achieve an industry-leading battery life of up to 7 days.      Send a quick reply by dictation       Pebble Time's new microphone lets you send voice replies to incoming notifications* or take short voice notes. We used the latest technology to maintain water resistance so you can swim or surf with Pebble Time (we do not, however, recommend talking underwater). *Sending voice replies works with most major Android apps including SMS, Hangouts, Gmail, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp and hundreds more. For iOS users, voice replies are currently limited to Gmail notifications. We’re working to enable voice replies for more apps.        Pebble Time is  20% thinner  than the original Pebble at just 9.5mm. Its ergonomic, curved design fits comfortably on either wrist and slides easily under dress shirts.   Pebble Time and Pebble Time Steel is stylish and durable. The lens is crafted from scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass with a bezel made of stainless steel. Like our previous watches, it's water resistant - perfect for a run in the rain, water-balloon battle or a swim. People love to personalize their Pebble watches. We've included a soft silicone band with each Pebble Time and a fine leather band for Pebble Time Steel, but any standard 22mm watch band will fit. All new Pebble watch bands include a quick-release pin, letting you swap bands in under 10 seconds. Now it's super easy to find the perfect style for you!       For DIYers, accessory makers and advanced customizers, we'll be publishing the 3D data you'll need to create amazing  straps ,  covers  and  docks .         Pebble Time comes in three colors:    Black watch case and silicone band with black PVD stainless steel bezel  White watch case and silicone band with silver PVD stainless steel bezel  Red watch case and silicone band with black PVD stainless steel bezel           Pebble Time Steel is available in three stainless steel finishes:     Silver with a stone leather band  Gunmetal black with a black leather band  Gold with red leather band   All Time Steels come with both a leather and matching metal band.    Special Engraving for Kickstarter Backers  All reward watches are engraved with ‘Kickstarter Edition’. For those who are backing Pebble on Kickstarter for the second time - thank you! Your Pebble Time watch will be engraved with something extra special.              We've been making smartwatches for almost 7 years now. Our ultimate goal is to make Pebble an indispensable tool in your daily life by helping you accomplish more each and every day.   While developing software for the original Pebble, we uncovered an important problem: apps are an inefficient way to interact with a smartwatch. As we increased functionality by adding more apps, our Pebbles clogged up. It became harder to quickly find the app we wanted. No one wants to manage another homescreen!  To make Pebble infinitely more useful, we needed an expandable system for organizing information and interactions. Luckily, the answer was right up our sleeves. It turns out the best interface for any watch...is time!        You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.    Play        00:00    00:00                                 You already plan your day around time, so it makes sense for your Pebble to be organized around the same principle. Now your notifications, news, reminders and events are laid out chronologically instead of being trapped inside separate apps.            With one click, see what’s coming up next. Your timeline connects to calendars, alarms, and apps, organizing all kinds of relevant information along with quick actions. Similarly, recall the past. Scroll back in time to see that email you missed, your step count for the day or the score from the game last night.   Your timeline takes an incredible amount of information and makes it super easy to access.       This is the new app menu, featuring new app faces with glanceable content. With timeline we've also created a system that dynamically loads and caches apps as needed, letting you access as many apps as you need. As with all Pebble software, we’ve built an open platform. You can allow apps and developers to add ‘pins’ to your timeline, so you can keep track of things like upcoming events, sports, weather, traffic, travel plans, pizza specials and more.  The Pebble operating system has been re-imagined with a new visual style. While all existing Pebble apps will still work great, we’re inviting developers to upgrade their apps to support color. More details coming soon!           Simplicity and focus, without compromise  We’ve added all these new features - color screen, microphone, slimmer design and timeline - without compromising what you love most about Pebble:  Always-on, daylight readable screen with a great backlight  Up to 7 day battery life (Time Steel battery life is up to 10 days)  Use any  standard   22mm   watch   band   Water resistant and durable   Tactile buttons for easy eyes-free clicking   Silent vibrating alarms  Step tracking with Misfit and Jawbone   Language and international character support  (Chinese coming soon!)  Timeline will work on Pebble and Pebble Steel (exact date TBD)  Works with iOS 8 on iPhone 4s and above  Works with all Android 4.0+ phones including Samsung, HTC, Sony, LG, Google, Motorola, Xiaomi and more            If you’re already part of our community of backers, developers and, early adopters, that’s fantastic! If not, we invite you to join those who have supported and guided our journey so far. It's pretty straightforward, just back this project! Keep your eyes glued to the Updates tab for all the latest news during the campaign.  We have a really exciting month planned! We pledge to do the absolute best we can at creating amazing products and supporting them for as long as possible. We’ve gone out of our way to develop new features, release software updates and provide technical support for all Pebble owners. Check out our  Amazon reviews  or our Twitter's  @Pebble  and  @PebbleHelp  to get a taste.      Developer community Since the first Kickstarter campaign, developers have been an integral part of the Pebble community. We are very proud of the 26,000+ developers who have created over 6,500 apps and watchfaces for Pebble. Pebble Time greatly expands possibilities for wearable apps, building on top of the existing Pebble SDK and tools:  Rich C SDK for apps and watchfaces running natively on the watch, even when the phone is disconnected  Best in class online development environment:  www.cloudpebble.net   New emulator that can be used on CloudPebble or locally  Rich set of APIs: accelerometer, compass, bluetooth messaging, background tasks, GPS and HTTP request, etc  (NEW) Color APIs to support the 64 colors of the new Pebble Time screen  (NEW) Support for PNG and APNG  (NEW) Timeline APIs to push information from the web into the user’s timeline (no watch or phone apps required)  (NEW) UI framework to create beautiful applications that take advantage of color and animations  (Later in 2015) Voice to text APIs: add voice recognition to your apps  (Later in 2015) Smart accessory port for hardware hackers.  (Later in 2015) Bluetooth Low Energy API. Use Pebble to control BLE-enabled objects.   All existing Pebble apps are compatible with Pebble Time and apps built with the new SDK are compatible with both platforms. We will reveal more information about the new APIs during the campaign. Stay tuned! Time for one last plug: we're hiring! Over the years, we've hired a bunch of folks from our community and are looking to hire more!

Upgrading to Time Steel Existing Pebble Time backers can easily change to or add a Pebble Time Steel by clicking the blue “Manage” button that appears next to your pledge amount. On the next screen you will be prompted to choose your new reward tier. Backers wishing to add a Pebble Time Steel in addition to their Pebble Time should select the  combo tier.Pebble Time and Pebble Time Steel will ship separately, so you wont have to wait. One thing to consider for Early Bird backers If you are an Early Bird backer of Pebble Time and change your reward to a Time Steel, it’s unlikely you will be able to switch back to your original Pebble Time Early Bird tier should you change your mind.

Supply Chain Risk   We’ve built a very capable team who have worked for the past 3 years on all our products. However, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur.

Better data has the potential to improve now education is delivered in developing countries Photograph: Muhammed Muheisen/AP      Sponsored by:  WSSCC    Claire Melamed and Grant Cameron   Friday 30 January 2015  11.36 GMT   Last modified on Friday 30 January 2015  11.48 GMT         Share on Facebook         Share on Twitter         Share via Email         Share on LinkedIn         Share on Google+         Share on WhatsApp                  A revolution starts with an idea, but to become real, it has to move quickly to a practical proposition about getting stuff done. And getting things done requires money. If the ideas generated last year, in the report of the  UN secretary general’s independent expert advisory group  (Ieag) and elsewhere, about how to improve data production and use are to become real, then they will need investments. It’s time to  start thinking  about where the money to fund the data revolution might come from, and how it might be spent.   Getting funding for investment in data won’t be easy. As hard-pressed statistical offices around the world know to their cost, it’s tough to persuade governments to put money into counting things instead of, say, teaching children or paying pensions. But unless the current excitement about data turns into concrete commitments, it will fade away once the next big thing comes along, leaving little in the way of lasting change.   So what is needed? Two things. First, there must be new money for investments in data. But, just as critical, that money must be spent in ways that enable and incentivise the change. The Ieag report laid out four areas in which change is needed: capacity and resources, technology and innovation, principles and standards, and partnerships and leadership. New money, used well, can support all these and help to drive the changes that are needed. In addition, four new funding streams might help to drive progress in the right direction:     Related:  The problem with the data revolution in four Venn diagrams     Funding for official statistics  As the Ieag said: “Strengthening national capacities will be the essential test of any data revolution”. Building on the idea of  country compacts , new money could be used to support change at the national level, supporting dialogue between data providers and data users, enabling new and useful partnerships between public sector, private sector and civil society, investing in the technological infrastructure, and rewarding measurable improvements in the production and use of high-quality data.  Funding for innovation  While official statistics will be the core, ignoring the potential for innovation to solve problems, create new possibilities, and leapfrog over current technologies, will in the long run be a waste of resources. Innovation is happening, and it is important that funds are available to ensure that there are incentives to innovate in the public interest as well as for the private sector. A starting point could to be to explore how new innovations could help to fill gaps in data for the new sustainable development goals, along the lines of the  SDG data labs  proposed by the Ieag report.     Related:  Technology and people power: 5 ways to shape the sustainable development goals     Funding for data literacy and use  A dedicated funding stream for civil society groups, to enable them to experiment with the collection and use of data, to strengthen data literacy and build capacity, and in the end to drive increased demand for and use of data will be a key part of using the data revolution to achieve long-term change in government policies and in the relationship between governments and citizens.  Funding for partnership and leadership  Most of the action, initiatives and financing required to drive the data revolution will happen at the national and local levels. But, as the Ieag report makes clear, global level partnerships and leadership can help to consolidate and share emerging lessons and develop standards, help to broker necessary partnerships, help to develop regional and global technology infrastructure, and help to showcase best practice and encourage innovation. This too, needs resources and political support to drive it.      Related:  Open data platforms: a tool to revolutionise governance     Good data is not cheap. But this is the moment to lay down the foundations for a future of high-quality, accessible and useful data. Good data will be essential for both monitoring and achieving the new sustainable development goals – and so funding for data could, and probably should, be a part of the discussion at the  Financing for Development  conference to be held in Addis Ababa in July. If governments, companies and civil society rise to the challenge of investing in data in ways that drive change and improvement, then that could be the moment when we know if the data revolution will be more than just a good idea.

Apple’s hardware today is amazing — it has never been better. But the software quality has fallen so much in the last few years that I’m deeply concerned for its future. I’m typing this on a computer whose existence I didn’t even think would be possible yet, but it runs an OS with embarrassing bugs and fundamental regressions. Just a few years ago, we would have relentlessly made fun of Windows users for these same bugs on their inferior OS, but we can’t talk anymore.  “It just works” was never  completely  true, but I don’t think the list of qualifiers and asterisks has ever been longer. We now need to treat Apple’s OS and application releases with the same extreme skepticism and trepidation that conservative Windows IT departments employ.  Geoff Wozniak  went back to desktop Linux  after almost a decade on OS X  (Update: He appears to have taken the post down).  It’s just one person’s story, but many of his cited reasons resonate widely. I suspect the biggest force keeping stories like this from being more common is that Windows is still worse overall and desktop Linux is still too much of a pain in the ass for most people. But it should be troubling if a lot of people are staying on your OS because everything else is worse, not necessarily because they love it.  Apple has always been a marketing-driven company, but there’s a balance to be struck. Marketing plays a vital role, but marketing priorities cannot come at significant expense to quality.  I suspect the rapid decline of Apple’s software is a sign that marketing 1  is  too  high a priority at Apple today: having major new releases every year is clearly impossible for the engineering teams to keep up with while maintaining quality. Maybe it’s an engineering problem, but I suspect not — I doubt that  any  cohesive engineering team could keep up with these demands and maintain significantly higher quality. 2  The problem seems to be quite simple: they’re doing too much, with unrealistic deadlines.  We don’t need major OS releases every year. We don’t need each OS release to have a huge list of new features. We need our computers, phones, and tablets to  work well first  so we can enjoy new features released at a healthy, gradual, sustainable pace.  I fear that Apple’s leadership doesn’t realize quite how badly and deeply their software flaws have damaged their reputation, because if they realized it, they’d make serious changes that don’t appear to be happening. Instead, the opposite appears to be happening: the pace of rapid updates on multiple product lines seems to be expanding and accelerating.      An important nuance that the many sloppy rewrites of this article keep getting wrong (intentionally for sensationalism?): I’m referring to  marketing  as a priority, not “the marketing department”. I have no idea about the internal workings of the marketing department and how it does or doesn’t influence the company’s direction. Marketing  priorities  seem to be a bit too influential, such as requiring a new major OS with every iPhone release, or a new OS X every year, for their marketing benefits.  ↩    People keep asking me whether a high-level executive change — Tim Cook, Phil Schiller, or Craig Federighi — is needed. I don’t know, of course — none of us really do — but I suspect that’s not really the problem. What seems to be the problem is the  overall  apparently agreed-upon prioritization put forward by the entire executive team.  This probably isn’t a “fire someone and fix it” problem — it’s simply an issue of poorly weighted priorities that can most likely be adjusted with the current personnel.  ↩      ◆                       Follow Marco.org posts:  Twitter ,  RSS feed , or the  alternate RSS feed  in which link posts always point here first instead of their targets.

Large enterprises are more discerning of Public Cloud IaaS offerings.  Test and development appears to be a key entry point for them since scale, operational complexity, and security/compliance/regulatory demands require a more nuanced approach to Public Cloud for IaaS.  Small and Medium enterprises have the greatest need for Public Cloud and should consider well-established, lower risk entry points to Public Cloud like SaaS, Email, and Web Applications before venturing into Mission Critical and IaaS workloads to help them navigate an increasingly complex and costly IT infrastructure environment.

R has been popularized by the growing data science community, for whom it has become the defacto standard. The deal is important not just for Microsoft but for the language itself, according to Dave Vellante, chief researcher at Wikibon.  R is copyrighted by The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, a non-profit organization based in Vienna, Austria. The copyright and the ownership of R is unaffected by the MS acquisition of Revolution.  According to Revolution Analytics Chief Community Officer David Smith, Microsoft used R to develop the  match-making  capabilities of the Xbox online gaming service. Microsoft data scientists apply machine learning to data from Bing, Azure, Office, and the sales, marketing and finance departments. Microsoft  supports  R extensively  within the Azure ML framework , including the ability to experiment and operationalize workflows consisting of R scripts in  MLStudio .”  Jeff Kelly at Wikibon weights in on the deal with his  breaking analysis .  “With the proposed acquisition of Revolution Analytics, Wikibon believes Microsoft has an opportunity to take significant strides in courting Data Scientists and other enterprise Big Data practitioners. It must continue to invest resources in Revolution Analytics’ core products, tightly integrate R with Microsoft’s existing and future Big Data portfolio of products, and, importantly, increase its activity with the open source community to ensure R continues to develop as an open source project in and of itself.”     Here is a video of David Smith at last year #BigDataSV event.  This year  #BigDataSV will be in force in San Jose during #hadoopworld.  Join us at #BigDataSV – registration here   If you’re interested in the business of big data, join SiliconANGLE and Wikibon teams with live @theCUBE broadcasts throughout the week of #Hadoopworld in San Jose.  Sign up here .  Register for #BigDataSV – Special @theCUBE Presentation  The Big Data market is moving into an exciting new phase. The early Big Data meme was all about data storage and processing technologies such as Hadoop and NoSQL. With Big Data moving into the enterprise, attention is turning to how to make Big Data initiatives more real-time and accessible to the business users to drive tangible business value.  If there is any question about this changing focus, just follow the money trail. Venture capitalists in the valley are increasingly placing their bets on start-ups that focus on these areas, including those that innovate around data visualization, machine learning, predictive analytics and operational applications. Big Data practitioners, who leverage these new technologies to upend existing markets and invent new business models, are also on the receiving end of more and more venture funding.  Join theCUBE, SiliconANGLE and Wikibon at #BigDataSV 2015 for a night of lively discussion and analysis of this new and exciting phase of the Big Data market. While our New York City agenda focused on public capital markets, our Silicon Valley emphasis will be on startups, innovation and venture/private capital. The agenda for the evening is as follows:  5:00pm-5:30pm:  Arrival and registration  5:30pm-6:00pm:  Wikibon Chief Research Officer David Vellante and Principal Analyst Jeff Kelly will present their research findings regarding the next phase of Big Data innovation, including identifying the hot technologies and start-ups that are helping Big Data practitioners turn data into insights and actions.   6:00pm-7:00pm:  SiliconANGLE Executive Editor John Furrier will host a panel discussion with influential venture capitalists who will share their view of the Big Data market and where they are placing their bets in this fast-moving market. Panelists include Accel Partners’ Ping Li, Ignition Partners’ Frank Artale and Vertex Ventures’ Jonathan Heiliger.   7:00pm-9:00pm:  Relax and enjoy stimulating conversation with other attendees at theCUBE Party at #BigDataSV 2015.

It’s a brand new way to wake up, made especially for those of us who hate the jarring noise             of an alarm clock. When you use Wakie, you get to start your day with a smile instead of a frown!    /FAQ 1    FAQ 2     How it works?  It’s easy, fast, and totally free.  Set an alarm for 7:00am and you’ll get a phone call from another Wakie member at 7:00am.             The calls last just 60 seconds — you’ll hear a warning at 50 seconds, and the call is             automatically disconnected at 1 minute. No awkward goodbyes, no long conversations —             calls are quick and casual. You can also choose to wake someone up yourself, too.   It’s totally anonymous and safe:  no phone numbers are visible or exchanged.    /FAQ 2    Join us    Join us!

    Apps - evolving in 2015      Each year Carat produces a trends report to help us think about how the worlds of technology and media will change over the next few years.      Dan Calladine , Carat’s Head of Media Futures, put together this year’s report, with help from experts around the business, including Mark Greenstreet, Matthew Jacobs, Alex Hooi, Graeme Wood, Angus Wood, Casey Fitzsimmons, and Mark Linford.      Over the next few days we’ll be looking at some of the most interesting trends for 2015 in detail.        “These are trends, not ‘the trends’. There are lots of things happening, and we hope we have chosen some the most interesting,” says Dan.      “Brands need to organise themselves for the real world – we highlight what the trends are, why they are growing, and give implications for brands, rooted in what we have observed this year.       “It’s a given that lots of things will continue to grow – including web access, mobile usage, ecommerce, and online video viewing.”      Today Dan looks at Trend 1 - App Simplification & Integration     Apps are big - according to Flurry, 86% of time spent on mobile is in apps, and just 14% on the mobile web.     These apps are now becoming more simplified – brands like Facebook are breaking off key tasks like messaging into single purpose apps.  At the same time it’s becoming possible for apps to integrate with other apps to share data and information, and to link to each other.     This means that brands need to re-think what their apps are for, and what they should functionality they should offer.     Facebook’s main app has pretty much all the functionality of the site. However now it’s splitting some areas, like messages, groups & local search, into single purpose apps, and others are following the same strategy.       Foursquare split off its check-ins to a separate app, Swarm. When Instagram added the ability to make time-lapse videos, it did so as a separate app, Hyperlapse.     The rationale for this is being made easier because apps are now less self-contained – they can link to each other.     For example, Uber has allowed other apps to embed an Uber button – so that you can open Uber easily, for example a button in the Starbucks app to call a car to take you to your nearest coffee shop.     Apple’s HealthKit in iOS8 lets a number of health and fitness apps share data, to get a fuller picture of the user’s activity levels.     Ads within the Facebook app can deep link into other apps, for example YPlan’s events ads which deep link into precise events in the YPlan app.     Over the next year it will become easier for developers to link apps. Twitter and Facebook both have code & resources to help app makers produce apps that will have common elements that can integrate well.     Twitter has ‘Fabric’, which offers a universal sign-in to apps, and access to Tweets and related tools, plus Twitter’s in-app ad service.     Facebook has ‘Parse’ which cuts down the differences between developing for different mobile operating systems, and will also standardise more of the way that apps work, also making it easier for apps to talk to each other.      Implications For Brands       The changes will strengthen apps’ roles in how people access content and services from their mobile devices.      Apps will be even more easy to use, and become inter-linked, like the web.      Brands need to think about what their apps should be for – which services they should offer, as simply as possible, and what they could link to.      If your app isn’t one that people will use every day, find ways of getting your app into one that is   Think about advertising your app, to both drive downloads and use.      If you don’t have an app, make sure the mobile web experience for the brand is as good as it can possibly be!

These apps are designed to help your night out run a hell of a lot more smoothly         Tweet      Place this tag where you want the +1 button to render.     Place this tag after the last +1 button tag.             1 | Best For The Disorganised: Y Plan        We've all been there. You attempt a spontaneous night on the razz, and, before you know it, you're being denied entry to a tragic dive bar, wistfully lamenting the just -missed last tube home. Y Plan wants to stop all that malarkey – it offers you a scroll-through curated selection of gigs, club nights and pop-ups in London. You pay on your mobile, and show your ticket on your screen. They’ve can even get you into sold-out events sometimes – snazzy.   yplanapp.com , available on  iTunes  and  Android , free     2 | Best For Getting Home: Uber     Desperately trying to hail a cab at 3am is never fun. Uber uses GPS to get your location, lets you book a taxi, track where it is, and you get a text when it arrives. It'll tell you how much your ride costs and even lets you split the fare with a friend electronically, meaning you never need to get slapped with the full whack ever again. Available in Manchester and London only at the minute.    uber.com , Available on  iTunes  and  Android , Free     3 | Best for the impatient: Bar Pass      There's not much worse than arriving at a bar and finding yourself stuck at the back of a collosal queue for drinks. Your nice, boozed-up haze is obliterated, and you return to your table half an hour later with an armful of half-spilled beverages. Bar Pass lets you skip the whole sorry process – you order your drinks, pay on your mobile and you'll be notified when they're ready.   barpassapp.com,  available on  iTunes  and  Android , free      4 | Best For Nights In The Capital: Time Out           Tourist or native, navigating the sprawling mass of all that's on in London is tricky. Use the 'hot bars' section of this app, you can swipe through photos of venues, read Time Out's opinion and user reviews on the place. The details tab gives you the venue's address and nearest tube station, admission prices and opening hours, for an easy estimate of when you'll get there and how much it'll cost you.    timeout.com , available on  iTunes  and  Android      5 | Best If You're Out Late: Bar Chick        Don't let the name put you off – this is in no way an app that's just for girls. Select whether you're with mates, a date or a client, and discover which bars are open late late. You can get information on what deals are going on to save a few quid, and it's available in all of the UK's biggest cities, as well as places like Ibiza, Florence and Amsterdam if you're abroad.    barchick.com , available on  iTunes  and Android        ***  MORE IN APPS:  5 Style Apps To Sort Your Wardrobe Out   Best Football Apps   50 Apps To Improve Your Life ***            Tweet      Place this tag where you want the +1 button to render.

Photograph: PR     Lanre Bakare  in New York   Monday 29 December 2014  22.33 GMT   Last modified on Monday 29 December 2014  23.51 GMT         Share on Facebook         Share on Twitter         Share via Email         Share on LinkedIn         Share on Google+         Share on WhatsApp                  The main witness in the murder case that was the subject of the wildly popular podcast  Serial  has given his first interview, revealing new details about the case.  Jay Wilds  spoke to The Intercept  about the case for an article published Monday. He’d previously refused to take part in Sarah Koening’s podcast, which attempted to retrace the steps taken in the murder case of Hae Min Lee, which led to the conviction of her ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed.  Wilds, who was the prosecution’s main witness, has changed elements of his story – including where he first saw Lee’s body. On taped interviews with police used in the podcast he stated that he first saw the body in the car park of a Best Buy. But when asked about it by The Intercept, he said he first saw it in front of his grandmother’s house.  “I didn’t tell the cops it was in front of my house because I didn’t want to involve my grandmother,” he said.  “I believe I told them it was in front of ‘Cathy’s [not her real name] house, but it was in front of my grandmother’s house. I know it didn’t happen anywhere other than my grandmother’s house. I remember the highway traffic to my right, and I remember standing there on the curb. I remember Adnan standing next to me.”  In the interview – the first of a multi-part series – Wilds talks about the first time he met Syed, and why he agreed to help him bury Lee’s body.  “At the time I was convinced that I would be going to jail for a long time if he turned me in for drug dealing, especially to high school kids,” he said. “I was also running [drug] operations from my grandmother’s house. So that would ruin her life too. I was also around a bunch of people earlier the day [at Cathy’s], and I didn’t want them to get fucked up with homicide.”  He also spoke about why he cooperated with the police after initially refusing to, saying that he was worried about criminal consequences for selling marijuana, and that he was concerned because Baltimore was notorious as a place where people who informed could be subject to retribution.  “They had to chase me around before they could corner me to talk to me, and there came a point where I was just sick of talking to them,” he said.  “I stonewalled them that way. No — until they told me they weren’t trying to prosecute me for selling weed, or trying to get any of my friends in trouble. People had lives and were trying to get into college and stuff like that. Getting them in trouble for anything that they knew or that I had told them — I couldn’t have that.”  The interview comes after writer Kelly Oxford tweeted a Facebook post, apparently from Wilds, in which he stated he was willing to participate in one interview.

Business   Feature     The fortunes of 4 British startups in 2014   Image Credit: SwiftKey    .entry-content-thumbnail     December 28, 2014 12:30 PM  Paul Sawers    .entry-meta-left              .entry-meta-right    .entry-meta    .entry-header     2014 was a mixed bag for tech companies around the world, with the likes of Uber seemingly  never out the headlines  for  all of the wrong reasons , while younger upstarts like Slack  gained praise across the board .  A number of notable stories emerged from the U.K. over the past 12 months too. For example, SongKick  reported record numbers (in both users and revenue) , however its fellow London-headquartered company  Hailo unfurled the white flag  on its American dream, with Uber’s brute force proving too much. And  Shazam nabbed another $20 million  to continue on its path to music-tagging market domination.  Here, VentureBeat looks back at the fortunes of a handful of startups from the U.K in 2014.  SwiftKey   2014 has been a good year for  SwiftKey , the smart keyboard app that replaces your phone or tablet’s default keyboard and learns your writing style over time.  While the London-based company has thrived in the Android realm, Apple’s move to open iOS to system-wide third-party keyboards proved a major boon for SwiftKey.  Fresh from a  $17.5 million funding round , SwiftKey  unveiled its much-anticipated iOS 8  app in September, and it went on to secure  1 million downloads in the first 24 hours  alone.  “This year I think we’ve all learned that while planning is essential, you have to be prepared to throw out your plans when an amazing opportunity comes along,” said Joe Braidwood, the chief marketing officer at SwiftKey. “When we started 2014, we had no idea we’d be able to bring a full keyboard app to iPhone users. We pulled together a team, built something we were really proud of – and shipped it, all in around three months.”   Although SwiftKey is better known for its clever keyboard app, it also does a lot of research and work within the artificial intelligence realm, with  partners  among many people and organizations. As a result, SwiftKey is on 250 million devices. And  SwiftKey is working with Stephen Hawking  to develop a system that would help him communicate twice as fast.  But perhaps one of the most notable shifts for SwiftKey, from a business perspective at least, was when it  moved from a $4 paid app to a completely free model , charging users through in-app purchases for extra features.  Just this week, SwiftKey announced a tie-up with Disney that  heralded in its first branded keyboard  (in this case, the hit Disney movie  Frozen ), as it explores further monetization avenues.  “It’s been an interesting year due to the transition to freemium — we made growth projections but it was hard to predict the exact results, as few companies have made this pivot before us,” Braidwood said. “But we exceeded our projections. Within a month [of going freemium] our install rate was up 54 percent.”  Looking forward to 2015, Braidwood says it’s all hands on deck as the company prepares to increase its userbase, with specific markets in mind. “Next year, we’re particularly interested in getting to know our customers in India better — we think it’s a really exciting place, with a lot of multilingual typers and we’d love to grow our userbase there.”  Mind Candy   If you have kids, you’ve likely encountered Mind Candy’s virtual pets — Moshi Monsters.  The insanely popular online service claims north of 80 million registered users, but the company behind Moshi has been spinning out the brand into merchandise,  movies , and games. This is a popular tactic when companies strike gold with one particular brand, as we’ve seen with Rovio’s Angry Birds.  Back in February, Mind Candy  launched a Super Mario Kart-esque  Moshi Karts game for iOS, followed by a new Candy Crush Saga-style match 3  game called Moshling Rescue  and a quirky photo-sharing community and iPhone app  called PopJam .  But all hasn’t been well in the world of Mind Candy or Moshi Monsters this year. Founder and CEO Michael Acton Smith stood down in July, in an open and frank video he posted to YouTube.   Later in the year, Smith revealed that  Moshi Monsters’ popularity was dwindling  and revenues weren’t healthy, which went some way towards explaining his stepping down.  As Moshi Monster’s popularity falls, however, Mind Candy has continued to explore other areas, including  World of Warriors , a combat-strategy game devoid of all-things Moshi. But it could become the new Moshi in many ways — and help the company tap into a mobile gaming market that’s pushing $25 billion at the end of 2014, according to market researcher NewZoo.  “We have big plans in 2015 to turn the brand into a franchise, expanding offline with trading cards, books and toys,” explains Darran Garnham, Mind Candy’s chief commercial officer. “Warriors underlines our ability to merge digital and physical, first from web, now from mobile. This crossover aids traction from both areas and increases brand recognition.”  Mind Candy has been pushing hard into the mobile realm of late, and World of Warriors has been gathering momentum, so this could well help save Mind Candy. But does this spell the end of Moshi Monsters as we know it? Not quite.  “Moshi remains core to our business — it’s been the cornerstone of our success and its fans are testament to the affection that it holds,” continues Garnham. “Our next move is to create the spark to push the brand into new markets, languages and introduce Moshlings to a whole set of new fans.”  So Moshi will live on, but it seems like World of Warriors will be a big focus in 2015, with in-game player-vs.-player being introduced and other related consumer products launching in 10 countries.  PopJam, too, will get some more lovin’, given the proliferation of touchscreen devices among kids. “We think there’s a huge opportunity to build a safe, fun and creative space for them [children],” says Garnham. “PopJam is our big project in this area and we’re looking forward to launching it globally into other markets in 2015. Its performance to date in the UK has surpassed expectations.”   YPlan   YPlan  has emerged as one of the brightest stars from the U.K. startup scene with its mobile-first approach to discovering the best events to go to today.  The last-minute ethos to booking events such as bands and live theater has clearly proved popular, with 30 percent of Londoners having the app installed on their iPhone — that’s quite a feat.  The company finally expanded beyond London with its  New York launch in late 2013 , before  arriving in San Francisco  in February this year and then Las Vegas. It has had 1.5 million downloads to date.  Fresh from a  $24 million funding round  just last month, in addition to the  $12 million it raised  the previous year, the company is looking to  expand its offering from last-minute events into a marketplace  that catches the entire long tail of events.  “This funding will be used to expand our footprint as well as product and engineering teams as we launch a range of new features, including ‘Invites,’ ‘Feedback,’ and ‘Preferences’ which will be released in the next few weeks,” said founder and CEO Rytis Vitkauskas.  Before that, YPlan has been busy building additional features, including a “Date Night” offering, acknowledging that many people use YPlan when looking for something to do with their partner.  YPlan has come a long way since its London-only beginnings back in 2012, going from a heavily curated “six to eight events” at any one time to many more. “We thought curating such a tightly focused list was what people wanted, but over time, we’ve learned that it’s not one size fits all,” said Vitkauskas. “There is an optimal number of events we can show you – it’s more than 10 and less than 50, and can vary from person to person – but it took time for us to realise that.”  Today, YPlan’s event curators shortlist as many as 100 events each day from around 1,500, before narrowing down its final selection for users. And by understanding its users more, YPlan should go from strength to strength next year.  “Knowing that 1.5 million people in the U.S. and U.K. recognize the value of what we do is a significant endorsement for us,” Vitkauskas said. “In addition to that, we also saw 300 percent growth year-on-year from 2013, and we have great momentum going into 2015.”  TransferWise   TransferWise  has emerged as a key player in the so-called  Fintech  startup realm, serving up a smart peer-to-peer international money transfer service that  cuts out the banks  to help save you money.  In June, TransferWise  announced a $25 million funding round , with big-name investors such as Richard Branson and Peter Thiel on board. It also  launched its service on Android , some six months after it had first gone mobile with iOS.  The company embarked on a major  “stop hidden fees” drive, too , with a dual offline-online antibank marketing approach ensuring it maximized its potential audience.   It seems this will continue to play a pivotal part in TransferWise’s push to garner the world’s attention, with the widely held notion that “banks are evil” proving an easy means of getting people on its side.  “Our biggest challenge is still getting people to understand how banks rip them off,” said Taavet Hinrikus, the cofounder of TransferWise, before adding that it managed to secure 18,000 signatures for its campaign to make the currency exchange market more transparent.  Looking forward to 2015, it’s going to be all about knuckling down and getting bigger. “We’re still going to be focusing on growth,” said Hinrikus. “We’ll be opening up new currency routes, localizing the website in new countries and, of course, we’ll keep working to make the FX market transparent and fair for consumers.”    .entry-content        Topics >   3UK   editor's pick   Mind Candy   swiftkey   Transferwise   uk   YPlan      #entry-meta    .entry-wrapper   #post-1628602     #comments    #content    #primary        Latest News         Here’s what the Mars One CEO had to say about all the backlash against the mission          Ellen Pao can file suit against Kleiner Perkins, judge decides            Trending Research          Marchex widget          Press Releases         Selling Simplified Closes $2.8M Funding Round of Growth Capital          Vasectomies, Wellness Treatment Searches Gain Popularity in the New Year          Svelte Medical Systems Secures Financing; Richard Dakers Joins Board      View more           Outbrain Sidebar Widget         #secondary .widget-area    END .content-wrap    END .body-container      Home  About  Contact  Careers  Advertise  Events  Privacy Policy  Terms of Service     © Copyright 2015  VentureBeat .

The critical vulnerability affects all Windows- and Mac-based versions of the official Git client and related software that interacts with Git repositories, according to an  advisory published Thursday . The bug can be exploited to give remote code execution when the client software accesses booby-trapped Git repositories.  "An attacker can craft a malicious Git tree that will cause Git to overwrite its own .git/config file when cloning or checking out a repository, leading to arbitrary command execution in the client machine," Thursday's advisory warned. "Git clients running on OS X (HFS+) or any version of Microsoft Windows (NTFS, FAT) are exploitable through this vulnerability. Linux clients are not affected if they run in a case-sensitive filesystem."  The vulnerability is sure to be a tempting one for blackhats to exploit, since it would haul in developers who have  proved to be popular targets in the past . The advisory gave no indication the bug is being or has been actively exploited. Fortunately, repositories on github.com can't be booby-trapped because the site has added a verification process to check for malicious content. Other sites hosting repositories don't necessarily provide the same safety measure. Git users should upgrade immediately. Updated GitHub for Windows and GitHub for Mac are available  here  and  here .    Expand full story        Reader comments   53     You must  login or create an account  to comment.

Initially a website and blog, I started this shop as Plutonium Muffins and decided to separate it out to Skinny Lizzy so that PM could stay as a knitting-only website! If you are here from Plutonium Muffins - you're in the right place, don't worry!  I aim to embrace life; I suffer from depression and find it difficult to work as a result. Being able to craft at home helps my mental health, and also helps me contribute! I take inspiration for my products from all over the place, but am particularly fond of literature and literary sources.  I'm always keen to try out new things, and if you like something you see but would like it personalised, let me know.  The Skinny Lizzy blog can be found at www.skinnylizzy.com.  Much love,  Corrie xx                                                                                                                                             Want to find out more?

Initially a website and blog, I started this shop as Plutonium Muffins and decided to separate it out to Skinny Lizzy so that PM could stay as a knitting-only website! If you are here from Plutonium Muffins - you're in the right place, don't worry!  I aim to embrace life; I suffer from depression and find it difficult to work as a result. Being able to craft at home helps my mental health, and also helps me contribute! I take inspiration for my products from all over the place, but am particularly fond of literature and literary sources.  I'm always keen to try out new things, and if you like something you see but would like it personalised, let me know.  The Skinny Lizzy blog can be found at www.skinnylizzy.com.  Much love,  Corrie xx                                                                                                                                             Want to find out more?

Many of them are simply short-cuts to existing functions in base R and are intended as a keyboard shortcut only. Others I have collected from places like Stack Overflow where someone has found a neat solution to a common problem - where this is the case I have cited the original author and provided a link to the original question.  This is a new package and doubtless contains many bugs - suggestions for improvements are very welcome!      /.repo-container     /.container    /.site    /.wrapper      Status  API  Training  Shop  Blog  About       © 2015  GitHub , Inc.

This card is made from recycled pages of a Harry Potter book (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), taken from the Christmas chapters of the story. With 3D effects as the tree pops from the page, this is a great and unusual way to wish someone a Very Harry Christmas! The card is A6 sized and has been left blank for your convenience. If requested, a sentiment can be stamped or written on the inside. Alternatively, if you would like the card to go to the recipient with a message already written inside it, this is also possible. Please let me know at time of payment using the 'note from buyer' box. Made with love by Corrie, the environment in which the card has been made is smoke free. The card is shipped in protective (but recyclable) packaging to ensure it is in the best condition we can get it to you in.

Join 3,500 people on April 23-24.          Nick Cicero    23 November '14, 06:00pm  Follow   Humans are walking  data  centers and our interactions and behaviors, no matter how minuscule, are building a near infinite pool of aggregate  data  over the course of our lifetime.  This  data  can be used to improve the experience of our lives through analysis of our consumption, interactions and behaviors; in business today, data has become a competitive advantage and necessary component of product development.  Considered one of the  sexiest fields  to pursue ( InformationWeek’s words , not mine), the  data  scientist is now assisting companies of all shapes and sizes make sense of these massive  data  sets to better inform business outcomes.  The field has become much more mainstream in recent years and forecasts are just as bullish on its growth.  General Assembly told TNW that the number of  data   science  students enrolling at GA  will more than double from 2013 to 2014, and the number of completed applications to the program has already tripled in 2014 vs. 2013.   In a 2011 report,  McKinsey Global Institute  estimated that by 2018 there will be 4 million big  data  related positions in the US.  And companies aren’t just actively recruiting, they’re opening up their pocketbooks. According to  data  from Glassdoor, the median salary for  data   scientists  in the United States is $115,000.  So why d ata  s cientists , and why now?  I spoke to a number of  data  professionals across multiple industries and found some of my own trends in the reasons why their profession is in such high demand.  Accessibility to  data  is greater than ever before  “We are now curating  data  at a much faster speed than we can curate the people who know how to work with it,” says Edward Podojil,  Data  Scientist at online home cleaning service  Homejoy .  The rise of online communities, e-commerce, mobile and the overall digitization of society has created new  data  sets that go beyond just number crunching.  “Anyone who has a website instantly is going to have something like Apache web servers, with something as simple as a logging feature,” Matthew Ruttley,  Data  Scientist at  Mozilla , tells TNW.  “It’s very easy for even a new software engineer to log a certain action on the site, such as if someone filled out a form or not.”  Companies look at the different interactions by different users within the site, from how they came in, to the activity taken on the site, to how they completed a particular activity. With the  data , teams can look at the optimal characteristics of users who have satisfied their goals.  Aside from pure transactional  data , we’ve evolved in our digital lives such that we’re publishing more contextual information online than ever before.  The tweets we post, the reviews we leave on Yelp, the blog posts we write, the searches we make… they’re all adding an additional layer on the  data  puzzle that really hasn’t been seen before, revealing new relationships about groups of people and their behaviors.  Data  is now crucial to product development  Data ’s influence on product development is easily seen in nearly every company today. Optimization based on this influx of  data  helps drive actionable business decisions in real time, whereas before  data  scarcity forced iteration based on gut, or unreliable and outdated information.  Still today, for all the  science  involved in applying  data  still requires a human intelligence to craft appropriate strategies to take advantage of this  data .   “Maybe you can’t write an algorithm to automatically increase conversions on your site,” says Ruttley. “But you could possibly write an algorithm that makes it easy for a human to understand what’s happening on the site, then the human can make the change in their behavior.“  That change can come in a number of forms depending on what the  data  is telling you. Companies might try changing messaging in ad copy, serving up different content within an app based on a user’s selections, geographic region, or changing the interface to inspire more action.  “One time we tried changing the color of a button in the app and it didn’t change the experience much,” John Sandall,  Data  Scientist at  YPlan , tells us.  “Then we changed the copy on one of the buttons and that drove up conversions 15 percent.”  With so many  data  points, it’s important to be able to experiment and continually test until you find the optimal mix that satisfies specific business KPIs.  Data  s cientists  help look at  data  across a number of different sources to help find that optimal mix.  We live in a balancing act of privacy  Today’s free-flowing exchange of ideas, goods and services is punctuated by one overarching relationship that’s constantly at the center of debate: the right to  data .  As mentioned before nearly every interaction is measured, giving these companies more access to map personas of the people using their technology. For the most part, this is a good thing – it helps the user experience improve and makes the things we love even better.  But a big part of that is also making these companies sustainable in the marketplace for the future, and that means experimenting and monetizing.  Earlier this year Facebook came under fire for just that. A team of Facebook  data   scientists  published a research study conducted by altering 689,003 users’ feeds over a week to  test their emotional reaction .  Entitled, Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks, the report came under serious scrutiny and caused so much of a stir that even  US Senator Mark R. Warner (D-VA)  asked privacy and consumer protection experts at the Federal Trade Commission to look into the Facebook study.  But who is to say what uses of  data  are good or bad?  Facebook is a seemingly easier target for negative attention because it’s already polarizing and so much larger than most other social networks. When things happen to Facebook, it wakes up a larger audience to the ramifications of what they’re giving up in order to interact online.  But other companies have received praise for their use of  data  as not invasive, but interesting and valuable forms of content marketing.  Take for example OKCupid, a company that has regularly used its user  data  unabashedly to draw insights about the psychology of human interaction and attraction.  In a blog post entitled  “We Experiment On Human Beings!”  OkCupid President Christian Rudder expressed, “if you use the Internet, you’re the subject of hundreds of experiments at any given time, on every site. That’s how websites work.” So why not use this groundswell of information to your advantage?  Via OKTrends  Rudder wrote an entire book based on his years of study of OKCupid users in an attempt to use personal  data  for good instead of “selling us stuff we don’t need.”  So for this new wave of  data   scientists , just having access to the data sets isn’t enough, it’s knowing how to make informed decisions that respect the user along the way and don’t disrupt their trust in the companies they interact with.  Of the five  data   scientists  I spoke with, none seemed to express much concern about threatening user privacy when it came to their  data  collecting methods. The common attitude was they absolutely respected users, indicating that they are much more than just numbers.  A more complex role than you think  Perhaps one of the main reasons that  data   scientists  are in such high demand is that they require an incredibly diverse skill set, which can sometimes be hard to find in people.  “The  data  scientist is someone who has fantastic communication and empathy ability, as well a lot of mathematical skill, and then the engineering skill they need to do the math that they want to,” says Hilary Mason, Founder at  Fast Forward Labs .  The  data  scientist spends a lot of time working on statistical analysis, developing machine learning algorithms, hacking and mining for  data , but also managing and communicating with multiple different teams within an organization.  For all businesses to achieve their goals together, there must be a sense of shared ownership of the  data  informing decisions between these departments. To help in aiding this organization-wide goal,  scientists  often sit among various groups to help facilitate discussion about how to best solve the answers to problems they’re individually facing as a department collectively facing as a company.  “I find myself working across multiple teams almost as a consultant,” says Podojil. “ Data   Scientists  help extenuate the communication across different teams, as well as helping each team figure out what it is they need to be looking for to drive their goals.”  Much of the  data  scientist’s role is not just to provide the  data  or answers to questions, but to educate these departments on how to ask the right questions. Perhaps that’s why the role is becoming so crucial and outlook so bright for the field.  “There’s a habit of  data   science  thinking in which, when faced with difficult decisions, you ask ‘Could  data  help me answer this question?’ or simply ‘What  data  are available to help me here?'” says Chris Wiggins, Chief  Data  Scientist with the  New York Times .  “That habit of thinking, and the willingness to bring  data  into decisions,” says Wiggins “… is the most important change in demand at corporations.”  Read next:   Data scientists: Sexy or insufferable?

(The second book of the “2 Books in 1!” is “Barbie [i can be…] an Actress.” We’ll get to that later.) Helen Jane has two little girls under the age of six. I have a daughter who is almost two. “This is great!” I said. “Barbie wants to be a computer engineer! And fifty stickers!” “Yeah, I was really excited at first, too,” Helen Jane said. “Because, like you, I believe in the good of people. But then, like I’m sure you’ve experienced a million times, I was reminded you should never believe in the good of people.” “Oh, no. Should I read it?” “You must. Immediately.” And now you all will, too. Because this is a real book. A book you could  buy right now  if you wanted to. A book that right now, somewhere, is teaching possibly hundreds of young girls and boys the following:   At breakfast one morning, Barbie is already hard at work on her laptop. “What are you doing, Barbie?” asks Skipper. “I’m designing a game that shows kids how computers work,” explains Barbie. “You can make a robot puppy do cute tricks by matching up colored blocks!” Barbie! That’s awesome. I love how your game is both educational and fun. Bonus points for keeping it cute, because you are so stylish. Please be careful not to drop your breakfast fro-yo on your laptop. I’ve done it, and it’s not so funzies. Anyway, Internet, get ready to find your thing to be super pissed off about today.   “Your robot puppy is so sweet,” says Skipper. “Can I play your game?” “I’m only creating the design ideas,” Barbie says, laughing. “I’ll need Steven and Brian’s help to turn it into a real game!” What the fucking shit, Barbie? This is where you assume Skipper will be like,  “Oh, why do you need boys? We can do it ourselves! Let’s learn and work hard and do things all on our own because a sense of accomplishment and knowledge are powerful weapons for adulthood.” But no. Nope. Barbie’s just fine ending her work with the “design ideas” and a laugh.  She’ll need the boys before she’ll have a “REAL GAME.” Wait, wait. I need you to know something, and this is hard for me to tell you, because I’m guessing that like Helen Jane and me, you maybe believe in the good of people. You still hope that when we turn the page, there will be something empowering for Barbie and Skipper to experience. That maybe Steven and Brian are… I don’t know, maybe they could still be girls? But, no. It’s about to get even more misogynistic up in here.    Barbie tries to email her design to Steven, but suddenly her screen starts blinking. “That’s weird!” says Barbie. Barbie and Skipper try to reboot the computer, but nothing happens. “Looks like you’ve got a virus, big sister,” says Skipper. “Luckily, I wear my flash drive on a necklace so that I’ll always remember to back up my work,” replies Barbie.   So, after this page, we– Hey, where did you go? Oh, I see you. You’re on the floor, face down, having given up. Yeah, we did that, too. Is it because it took two girls to reboot a computer? I feel bad for every time I made fun of my mother using technology, because right now some mom is having to read this book to her daughter, and after the “weird” blinking screen and reboot, she’s having to describe the computer’s state as: “nothing happens.” Are you still on the floor because Barbie wears a flash drive around her neck? And that it’s a giant pink heart? At least Skipper’s doing her best to help the situation by pouring her sister some juice. Girls can be so helpful in the kitchen.    “May I borrow your laptop, Skipper?” asks Barbie as she follows her little sister into her bedroom. “I really should finish my homework assignment. I am writing about a person I admire,” says Skipper. “I only need it for a minute,” adds Barbie. “Okay,” says Skipper.   Run, Skipper! Run from the haunted flash drive!    When Barbie puts her flash drive into Skipper’s laptop, the screen starts blinking. “Oh, no!” says Barbie. “The virus must be on the flash drive!” “I forgot to back up my homework assignment!” cries Skipper. “And all my music files are lost, too!”      “I’m so sorry, Skipper,” says Barbie. “I have to run off to school now. But I promise to find a way to fix your laptop.” “You better!” Skipper replies as she playfully hits Barbie with a pillow.   A PILLOW. SKIPPER HITS HER SISTER WITH A PILLOW. PLAYFULLY. Skipper has just lost her homework, all her music files and her laptop, but all she’s moved to is STATUS: PILLOW FIGHT.    Barbie makes it to computer class just before the bell rings. As soon as class begins, Barbie raises her hand. “Yes, Barbie?” asks Ms. Smith, the teacher. “If your computer gets a virus and crashes, how can you retrieve all the files you lost?” asks Barbie.   The fact that Barbie’s comp sci teacher is female almost lets you assume things are about to get less insulting. Don’t fall for it.    “Well, first you remove the hard drive from the crashed computer,” explains Ms. Smith. “And then you hook it up to another computer.” “But won’t the other computer get the same virus that made your computer crash?” asks Barbie. “Not if the computer has good security software installed,” says Ms. Smith. “Good security software protects your computer from catching a virus.”   Barbie gets told how to do something, so what do you think she does next? That’s right. Go find some boys to fix her computering!    After class, Barbie meets with Steven and Brian in the library. “Hi, guys,” says Barbie. “I tried to send you my designs, but I ended up crashing my laptop — and Skipper’s too! I need to get back the lost files and repair both of our laptops.”      “It will go faster if Brian and I help,” offers Steven. “Great!” says Barbie. “Steven, can you hook Skipper’s hard drive up to the library’s computer?” “Sure!” says Steven. “The library computer has excellent security software to protect it.”   IT WILL GO FASTER IF BRIAN AND I HELP, offer the men voices. “Step aside, Barbie.” YOU’VE BROKEN ENOUGH, NOW. From Helen Jane: Steven and Brian are nice guys, I’m sure. But Steven and Brian are also everything frustrating about the tech industry. Steven and Brian represent the tech industry assumption that only men make meaningful contributions. Men fix this, men drive this and men take control to finish this. Steven and Brian don’t value design as much as code. Steven and Brian represent every time I was talked over and interrupted — every time I didn’t post a code solution in a forum because I didn’t want to spend the next 72 years defending it. Steven and Brian make more money than I do for doing the same thing. And at the same time, Steven and Brian are nice guys.    “I’ve got Skipper’s assignment from the hard drive!” exclaims Steven. “Fantastic!” says Barbie. “And her other files, as well?” “I’ve got everything,” says Steven. “Now let’s retrieve the files from your hard drive. Both laptops will be good as new in no time!”   High-five, dude. High-fucking-five.    The next morning, Barbie gives her sister a big surprise. Skipper turns on her laptop– and it works! “My lost assignment!” cries Skipper. “You are just too cool, Barbie! You fixed my computer AND saved my homework!” Skipper gives Barbie a huge hug.   Barbie not only waits until  the next morning  to return her sister’s computer, she completely takes all the credit that it’s no longer broken! What an asshole!      At school, Skipper presents her assignment to the class. “Hi, everybody,” she says. “The person I admire most is Barbie — a great sister and a great computer engineer!” Everyone is impressed by Skipper’s presentation.   What?!  Oh, wait. Didn’t she mostly write this assignment  before  the crash?  Let’s give Skipper a pass. She almost lost enough already this week. Besides, if we upset her we’re likely to get trapped in the middle of one of her combination pillow fight/bikini car washes.    At computer class, Barbie presents the game she designed. Ms. Smith is so impressed that she gives Barbie extra credit! Barbie’s terrific computer skills have saved the day for both sisters! “I guess I can be a computer engineer!” says Barbie happily. THE FUCKING END, PEOPLE. Despite having ruined her own laptop, her sister’s laptop, and the library’s computers, not to mention Steven and Brian’s afternoon, she takes full credit for her game design– only to get extra credit and decide she’s an awesome computer engineer! “I did it all by myself!” Flip the book and you can read “Barbie: I can be an Actress,” where Barbie saves the day by filling in for the princess in Skipper’s school production of “Princess and the Pea.” She ad-libs and smiles her way through her lines, and charms the entire audience. Standing ovation, plenty of praise. At no point did she need anybody’s help. She didn’t even need lines! Just standing there being Barbie was enough for everyone in attendance. See, actors? It’s not that hard. Even Barbie can do it. When you hold the book in your hands to read a story, the opposite book is upside down, facing out. So the final insult to this entire literary disaster is that when you read “Barbie: I Can Be a Computer Engineer,” it appears that you are so fucking dumb, you’re reading “Barbie: I Can Be an Actress” upside down. Helen Jane and I were so livid after reading this book we spent the first fifteen minutes spitting out syllables and half-sounds. We’d go from outraged to defeated to livid in the span of ten seconds.  “I want this thing to start a meme of girls screaming, ‘I don’t need a Brian or a Steven!’” We knew we had to share this with you, because if we didn’t, we’d be saying it was okay. We couldn’t just roll our eyes at how insulting this book is, how dangerous it is for young minds, how it’s a perfect example of the way women and girls are perceived to “understand” the tech world, and how frustrating it can be when nobody believes this is how we’re treated. Just about every  review  we could  find  on this book had readers equally offended and frustrated. Oh, and the 50 stickers? I only saw one: “Nerdy is the new Fab!” The others had already been removed by Helen Jane’s small daughters. We can only hope that one of them doesn’t boast,  “My other laptop is a boy!” Barbie   Computers   Feminist   Girls   Helen Jane   Parenthood Share It                               Previous post That Time Retta Called Me Out on Twitter (Further Adventures in Fan Face)   Next post I Can Be… Exhausted 193 Comments   Kat   November 17, 2014 Oh good Lord.

Reply   Paul Tabachneck   November 17, 2014 From experience, I’m just going to suggest that you pick your wall carefully (This is not an endorsement of wall-head engagement).   Reply   Chris Snyder   November 20, 2014 Definitely pick your wall carefully. You wouldn’t want to put a hole in it and need to call a boy to come fix it.   Reply   RickF   November 22, 2014 This is a terrible book. But it does bring up the debate- why do these attitudes persist? I have a few credentials here; my dad, an electrical engineer, taught my older sister math at the kitchen table in third grade. She excelled, and was allowed ( this is the sixties ) to skip a year in math only. So, she was eventually  taking Calc I and II in 11 th grade. She went to MIT and graduated with a degree in applied math. After a few years working for DoD, she went to law school and is now a lawyer. Why? She didn’t like the work. So, we KNOW that learning the subject matter is not the issue. I am now a software engineer doing scientific and medical algorithm work. I spend sometimes 8 ( or more ) hour days with the only social interaction being small talk with a Starbucks employee. I enjoy the immersion and focus without interruption. Plenty of men don’t like this, but I wonder if MORE men like this type of work the women. It may be one of preference rather than only stereotyping. That said, the book is stupid either way.   Reply   Jen   November 28, 2014 RickF: I suspect that your “8 hour solitary immersion” experience is an outlier. That may be possible if you’re working for a company as their primary or even sole developer/engineer on a project, perhaps as a contractor that only needs to meet with someone to gather major requirements. Most people, even in tech, have to work on teams of multiple people, which usually require meetings on a regular basis that break up the day (sometimes disruptively so). I actually dislike having to work in the office, because my [mostly-male] coworkers talk too much and it’s distracting. When they’re not talking in person, they’re frequently gabbing it up on IRC. And they love going out for beer after work. Don’t get me wrong — socializing with my coworkers is great. I just don’t think that the “socially isolated geek” stereotype is the norm any longer, even for engineers and programmers. Most women start out capable and enjoying the work that they do in STEM…until they run up against the status quo BS. Real life story that happened only 2 years ago: I work in tech, and I was on a project team (only woman on the team…and there might have been only one other woman at the party who wasn’t there as a signficant other) that was doing some pretty cool work. Our team was invited to a reception to meet other people involved, including the funders. Our team was being introduced to one of the funders, and the funder went around shaking everyone’s hands. He shook the person’s hand next to me, skipped me without missing a beat or acknowledging me, and went right on shaking hands down the line telling everyone how much he liked our work. I think he had pretty much assumed I was just there at the reception as someone’s girlfriend. I’ve had people ask my boyfriend for technical advice (he was an artist, but looked “geeky”) and even offer him a technical job where they would train him because he “looked smart”, while I was sitting there remotely configuring a server from my laptop for fun. I spent years under a boss where I would present an idea to him, and he would turn it down, and then another [male] coworker would present the same idea to him 15 minutes later and he would accept it and give credit to the other coworker. A different [male] coworker noticed the pattern and told me that he thought it was because I was a woman, and the boss had some kind of issue with it. At the time, I didn’t believe my coworker, because this was one of my first jobs and I hadn’t had as many other experiences. Then my boss left and we replaced him…and suddenly my ideas were actually listened to the first time they were presented. It doesn’t happen every day, but this kind of thing still happens often enough to not just be “a few bad apples” story. I’m sure most women in STEM have a similar laundry list of incidents. The point is, I stick with it because I love it and can’t imagine doing anything else with my life. But most people — women included — don’t feel a “calling” to work in STEM. They’re there because they’re smart and they find it interesting and it makes decent money. Most people aren’t going to stick around at a job where they’re constantly told, “You don’t belong here.” If you have multiple ways to put your intelligence to good use that you like equally and that pay you, you’re going to refuse to put up with the BS and go somewhere else…which is what a lot of women do.

Reply   TrailDreaming   November 22, 2014 That is just so weird that the story goes that she took credit for the contirbutions of her male friends. I have been a female engineer for 25 years and it neve goes like that. The way it usually goes is the female makes a contribution and men take the credit.  Men have taken my code, rmoved my name (not changes the variable names) and presented my work as their own. It gets worse… (for real)   Reply   Jennifer   November 26, 2014 I am (or I guess I should say was, I’m a stay at home mom now) a software engineer. I did once work with a girl who was a truly terrible programmer. She was brought in to do a small contract job and I think we ended up rewriting the very little she managed to accomplish shortly after she left. Anyway, from talking to her it was clear that she’d been skating by at all of these other companies by getting the guys to do her work for her. So it does happen. I wouldn’t call that the norm though. I love programming and I miss it, but I left because my job was becoming less and less about programming and more about dealing with corporate political bullshit and staying home with a crying baby sounded like a lot more fun.

The book was written by Susan Marenco ( http://www.susanmarenco.com/ ), whose website has the title “Your Site Title,” so maybe she’s calling in her own personal technological experiences as a stand-in for Computer Engineer Barbie’s, rather than talking to a computer engineer to find out what they actually do?

Reply   Neeneko   November 19, 2014 It would be a bit of a hazy case, but in general doing a page by page critique of a work with substantial commentary relative to the amount copied would count as fair use. If the book’s author decided to press the issue, their lawyer would likely recommend dropping the case unless the intent was to harass as opposed to win.   The case would be just hazy enough SLAPP laws would probably not come into effect and the author might be able to scare an ISP or host into pulling the content, but if it went to court and both sides had adequate legal council, the chances of finding for the author would probably not be very good.

If it isn’t a reproducible content then it wouldn’t fall under actual legal copyright laws.

I respect that you went in for as small a changeset as possible, and the sticker format is brilliant! If it were practical, I think a full rework would be even better. Barbie as designer and full-fledged collaborator is good, especially when paired with competence in getting out of (as well as into) computer difficulties – but misses out on the promise of the front cover (“engineer”, Linux, binary on the screen).   Reply   mortymortadella   November 19, 2014 Brilliant :)  This refactoring should’ve been the official release.

Reply   Robert Murphey   November 20, 2014 Wow, Karen – that is epic. Thanks for this.  The entire write up of the book was extremely disheartening for me.  My daughter is 12 now, and is keenly interested in many things, including computer programming and designing game assets like artwork and texturing. First, the entire GamerGate fiasco, and now this? I’ve already had to talk to her about how girls are not treated well in tech industry – due to the taunting of some spiteful boys who she totally beat down in some Pokemon battles online.

I use my vintage (and new) Barbie collection to talk to parents about having discussions with their children. So I’m not entirely anti-Barbie.

Reply   GrumpyProfessor   November 17, 2014 I taught a Gender and Computing class for a couple of years and had thus two Computer Engineer Barbies purchased with university money so we could look at the gender bias in the dolls. Here we go: * Yes, pink laptops (Macs, with an App you can get for your iPhone)  * pink phones  * Barbie wears glasses (pink)  * Her blonde hair is in a ponytail (okay, sort of)  * She has a bluetooth receiver in her ear (pink). This is kind of a guy thing, but whatever.  * She is not wearing a T-Shirt with ALT+F4 or something on it, but a close-fitting blousey thing with computer keys printed on it. Apparently the designer didn’t get the memo on the joke T-Shirts.  * [I hope you are sitting down] Barbie is wearing tight *leggings*. WTF? Where do I put my keys and my Swiss army knife and my dongle and my USB sticks if I don’t have pockets??? The “briefcase” that comes with Barbie (silver) only fits the pink Mac.  * The killer: Since Barbies come in high-heeled only, and someone noticed that Computer Engineers don’t usually walk around in 5 inch spike heels, she has flat loafers with insets to fill up the high heel, meaning that she can’t stand straight. I have the two on my shelf and explain it to people who ask. And I join the choir: #fail, Mattel, #fail.   Reply   Carrie   November 17, 2014 This book is embarrassing on several levels, but I have a slightly different perspective on the physical look of the dolls you mention. I think it’s defeating to women and girls to suggest that they *must* look a certain way to be happy/successful/etc.  However, I find it just as defeating to say they *cannot* look a certain way and be successful at something. The link between professions and clothing/hair/beauty choices seems to be more of a result of bias, exclusion, and peer pressure than of any organic connection.  Is there any substantial reason Barbie can’t wear leggings and 5″ heels while she’s coding?  Or that the same brain that likes solving engineering problems can’t enjoy aesthetic pleasures or pampering like cute hair and a stylish manicure?  No one tells the boys they can’t like “typical” male pursuits like sports or fast cars, do they? Reinforcing stereotypes – of engineers who must look like they don’t care about fashion or of fashionable girls who must not be smart or interested in intellectual pursuits – doesn’t help anyone in my view. My whole career I’ve seen how much easier it is to be respected if I dress sloppily, don’t apply make-up, etc.  But I’m never happy playing that part because it just isn’t me.  I’m from the South, I grew up competing in pageants, I love fashion (including – and especially – very high heels), and by God I love having my hair blown out.  I promise you none of those things effect my engineering skills in the slightest. I’m seeing this problem play out with my niece – despite my very tom-boyish sister’s best efforts, her 4 year old daughter is a princess.  She wants to dress up, she wants things to be pretty, and you’d better believe she wants everything pink.  I had to hand-dip an entire Erector Set in glitter to interest her (don’t get me started…), but when I did she built circles around her 7 year old brother. What do you think the chances are that she’ll pursue anything engineering related, though, if none of the toys are aesthetically pleasing to her and she can’t relate to anyone in the industry because they all tell her she needs to change the way she is to fit in? I think the answer is more diversity, not less.  Let Barbie have her leggings and 5″ heels, just give her a casual friend to hang out with (and a black engineering friend, and a trans engineering friend…). /rant   Reply   John Williams   November 17, 2014 I tried wearing Leggings and 5″ high heels while programming once and Grumpy Professor is right they are incompatible. I don’t know why something about the angle of the foot seems to keep the C++ compiler from properly interpreting preprocessor directives. I know it is a nitpick but Barbie is doing software engineering not computer engineering and despite what the OP has said spec’ing and designing is a huge part of the process.  I spend at least as much time in the design phase as I do writing code.  Additionally Program Managers aka the people who collect Business Requirements, design features and similar are essential to software development. If I were to change this book to be less insulting I would - Call her a software engineer.  - Talk about how her designs tell steve and whoever how to make the software  - Show how her understanding of coding and systems engineering helps her make good designs  - Remove all the crap about the computer virus because that is A+ cert stuff and has little to nothing to do with either software engineering or computer engineering.  Someone who troubleshoots technical issues would be a computer technician at the low end and a support engineer at the high end or possible and support escalation engineer at the very high end.   ( I would say though that at least removing the harddrive and using another system to scan and inspect is a viable solution.  I could have been worse.  The teacher could have given her a strategy that wouldn’t work.  Though they did forget to also clean the flash drive.  Also after retrieving the files, I would have reinstalled the OS from scratch out of fear of a root kit or similar left over even after a virus scan.  Also I would have used a computer that was not only had security software but was also a different OS. I know I’ve gone a bit here, but I also find it funny that Barbie is allowed to plug a harddrive into the library’s computer.  First because that is one heck of a permissive policy the library has and second because plugging in a harddrives would most likely involve taking the library’s computer at least partially apart.   And laptop harddrives usually though not always use non standard connectors and form factors.   On the other hand Barbie did get the harddrive out all on her own and didn’t even make a deal of it so presumable she either has a laptop that makes change the harddrive very easy or performed some pretty technical work on the background ) - She could have talked about why she loves the creative process and sharing her games with people.   Reply   Misc   November 18, 2014 “software engineering not computer engineering” / “computer technician” / “support escalation engineer” Other books in that collection are called “Barbie – I can be a baby doctor”, “Barbie – I can be a pet vet”. The simplification of the career title is within the editorial line, and completely irrelevant.   Reply   John Williams   November 18, 2014 obstetrics gynecologist are probably too big as words for the target audience.  So baby doctor is a reasonable. I knew and continue to know a lot of veterinarians and the majority of them work with large animals.  Pet Vet while cute also makes it clear what type of vet Calling someone a computer engineer rather than a software engineer doesn’t seem to be simplifying it rather it just seems wrong.   But maybe I am wrong.  I’ve been steeped in computer science and related fields for so long that I am perfectly willing to accept that I can no longer reasonable judge what someone who isn’t would find easy or hard to understand about the field. So point taken. I still think though if the point of the books is to get young girls interested in STEM careers then spending some time talking about why she likes the work even if it is the design side would be helpful.  Even a through away line like “By making games, I help people have fun” or “Working with computer if I can dream it I can make it”  seem like they would be good.   The way the book shows the work, I wouldn’t want to get into it.   Carrie   November 18, 2014 LOL on the shoes and leggings John.  I wouldn’t have a problem with Barbie being a software engineer or a designer or anything else as long as A. she wasn’t always put into stereotypical roles in any industry and B. her role was not diminished by having to ask boys for help.  Lots of ways to position this that would have been WAY better than this.   Reply   Mr. Miller   December 1, 2014 Lets approach what you said with equality. A.  She isn’t always put into stereotypical roles. Which, if approached by equality, means men would not be in stereotypical roles either. Which means, men would be in the roles women are stereotyped into, and women would be in the roles men are stereotyped not to. All these does is reverse stereotypes, and create a new stereotype.  Your not ending stereotypes, your perpetuating them. B.  Her roles were not diminished by asking boys for help. Well, would asking women not diminish her role?  Because by how you stated it, that is how it sounds.  And if your saying that, all your statement equates to is. Men are inferior to women, and asking a man, as a woman, is diminishing, since men are inferior. Which is more sexist than anything this book has written. And if we assume, that the gender in that sentence you typed, meant less than describing whom she was asking for help from. Then your saying its a bad thing to ask for help, from other people.  Or that she should ignore the rest of her development team, and do it all herself. For which there is a problem, as teamwork is a trait very HIGH in demand in the tech world.  Because its very uncommon. Forbes has somewhat recent articles talking about this, as does small business, and several other business related articles.  Teamwork is lacking and important! Though, I do agree with your other sentiment.  Barbie can design GUI’s for game design, wearing any type of high heel she owns.  She can look however she wants.   Alex   November 18, 2014 Please point out where anyone anywhere in this comment section said “women should NEVER wear pink, have long hair, wear makeup, or in any way be stereotypically girly.” Go ahead. Quote ONE SINGLE COMMENT that says this. You can’t, because NOBODY IS SAYING THAT. I don’t know where you live where women are respected MORE for not giving straight men something pretty and weak-looking to stare at (and let’s be honest here, that is the SOLE PURPOSE of the standard of “femininity” that you are so desperate to cling to–please stop pretending it exists for our benefit), but I’d sure love to move there. So your daughter won’t play with anything that isn’t pink. Where, pray tell, do you think she picked that up? She doesn’t exist in a vacuum. How about instead of painting her Erector Set pink, you try teaching her that it is okay if girls play with things that AREN’T pink? Better yet, how about teaching her that the whole idea of colors and inanimate objects having genders is stupid, and that women are not ornamental objects whose primary function in life is to be pretty? Yes, the answer IS more diversity, not less. How you figure that continuing to force girls into the stereotypically girly pink sparkly molds straight men want them forced into is going to encourage “diversity” is beyond me, though.   Reply   Emma   November 18, 2014 I don’t think anybody is saying that anybody is saying (er…) ‘engineers can never look like this’. Expressing surprise, though, at an engineer looking a certain way is nonetheless disheartening for anyone reading who’s an engineer and doesn’t fit the commenter’s preferred mould because it does imply there is an ideal way for an engineer to look. I agree the beauty and fashion industries have their roots in heteropatriarchal societal structures which are ultimately damaging to everyone (especially women). However aware you are of that, though, it’s hard to force your own tastes to change. And it’s really disheartening to see someone going ‘if she’s an engineer why is she wearing leggings’, because yes, arguably the valourisation of revealing clothing on women (and also the simultaneous devaluing of revealing clothing on women, because we can’t freaking win) is an instrument of patriarchy, but it has *nothing to do* with her being an engineer. Setting up new false standards doesn’t help anything. I don’t want my clothing to be seen as a signifier of *anything* to do with my work. I want female engineers to be able to go to work in jeans and male engineers to be able to go to work in dresses and vice versa and for nobody to bat an eyelid because, in the context of their work, it *doesn’t freaking matter*.   Reply   Beti   November 18, 2014 Please take a breath, Alex. No one is saying “no woman should ever wear pink” but GrumpyProfessor is pretty damned dismissive of the idea of a computer engineer wearing heels and leggings and pink clothes. I’m with you – more diversity is better. And I think that’s the point of the objections to GrumpyProfessor’s comment. It just comes across to me like more rules women have to follow to be a “real” scientist/engineer/whatever. I’d like to hear back from GrumpyProfessor because maybe I’m misinterpreting the comment but it sure sounds like that’s what s/he said.   Reply   GrumpyProfessor   November 20, 2014 I didn’t realize that my words could be interpreted as insisting that “real” engineers who are women only slouch around in jeans, T-Shirts with sayings on them, and healthy shoes, just because I do. My worry was that this idea of showing young children this highly stereotypical picture of a woman who is an engineer was highly annoying. It would have been better to have her in high heels and a T-Shirt, for example, and a bit less on the pink side.   Dana   November 22, 2014 I wonder if you have daughters,  yourself? Speaking as a feminist mother with three daughters, I can tell you that raising them to be strong individuals is not the same as telling them how they should dress. Nor can a mother control their tastes. Nor should she.   Reply   Emma   November 18, 2014 This, this, all of this. Little girls being attracted to pink and frills and femininity is cultural and the result of how gender roles end up warping and limiting everyone’s brains and tastes. The way to change that is not to make fun of people who have already been enculturated into liking those things. Ultimately what we are talking about is stereotypes which are being perpetuated by marketing, which exist within a deeply embedded capitalist social structure, so I’m not actually sure we *can* take simple steps to change it without restructuring our entire culture from the ground up first. But mocking people’s choices (which are not made in a vacuum, but then no choices are) doesn’t fix anything. Also, the fact that so many people are still so freaking focused on *how she looks* (would the same things be said about a male software engineer in skinny jeans or a tie? Really?) is part of the problem. (PS: I am coding and I am wearing leggings. WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW, GRUMPYPROFESSOR?)   Reply   John Williams   November 18, 2014 “(PS: I am coding and I am wearing leggings.

Ultimately what we are talking about is stereotypes which are being perpetuated by marketing, which exist within a deeply embedded capitalist social structure, so I’m not actually sure we *can* take simple steps to change it without restructuring our entire culture from the ground up first. But mocking people’s choices (which are not made in a vacuum, but then no choices are) doesn’t fix anything. Also, the fact that so many people are still so freaking focused on *how she looks* (would the same things be said about a male software engineer in skinny jeans or a tie? Really?) is part of the problem, not a solution to it. (PS: I am coding and I am wearing leggings. WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW, GRUMPYPROFESSOR?)   Reply   Mike   November 22, 2014 I think I love you. My daughter also loves princess stuff and clothes, but she’s got a keen and sharp mind. It would be a terrible shame if she was to end up being excluded from some professions because she’s not wearing a nerdy enough t-shirt.   Reply   Guti   November 17, 2014 I strongly suggest you thoroughly check your Gender and Computing class material. Maybe you’ve been doing more harm than good. - Pink. So what?  - Glasses? Any gender bias with glasses I hadn’t realized? (Yes, they are… pink! They even match the rest of the outfit! Oh my god!)  - Ponytail. Actually, I’ve known quite a few software engineers who wear it. Some of them are male.  - Bluetooth receiver… guy thing… Sorry, I don’t get it.  - Leggings and high heels… I haven’t tried myself this one, but I suspect they don’t interfere with designing or coding. And many people do wear those, and I suspect as well they have car keys and USB sticks; they figured out how to overcome that… To summarize, if you are talking seriously, your Gender and Computing classes are really full of stereotypes and you spend an awful lot of time teaching how an engineer should… look! I just can’t believe it.   Reply   Deirdre Saoirse Moen   November 21, 2014 FWIW, I wore jeggings nearly every day of the 5-1/2 years I worked at Apple as a software engineer. As my husband says, “pockets are a feminist issue.” That said, I usually wore the politically expedient Nike trainers (because Tim Cook’s on the board of Nike, many of the fitness events we had at Apple had Nike tie-ins).   Reply   Monica   December 10, 2014 Is there a word for sexism masquerading as anti-sexism? Color is an important part of branding. Look at UPS, Target, and Home Depot. Everything that comes with Barbie is pink because pink is the brand’s color.  How is the hair relevant? Are you saying that blonde women can’t wear theirs in a ponytail? I suspect I’m missing exactly how this fits in.  How are Bluetooth receivers a “guy thing?” I have five nieces and I know for a fact that four of them, plus one of my sister-in-laws, use them on a regular basis. I would except for the fact that the only reason I even own a cell phone (which is pink, by the way. My decision) is for roadside emergencies. Are you also going to tell us that we can’t put on coveralls when we have to go in the crawlspace to do some repair work? Coveralls and home repairs are “guy things.”  Kids like themes. I don’t know any 8 year olds who know what ALT+F4 is, and to them a plain text reference they may not understand on a shirt would break the theme. Having Barbie’s name spelled out on her blouse using computer keys (judging by the pictures I’ve seen), in addition to reinforcing the Barbie branding, fits the computer theme with the use of key graphics.  Where do you carry those things without pockets? In your purse. Men need pockets because they generally can’t get away with carrying purses. I’m not a computer engineer, but I work extensively with computers and when I have to present an STL file or a mobile app or a program to a client I, preferring immediate feedback face to face over delayed emails, deliver it on a USB stick. Unless I’m working around the house I wear skirts and dresses exclusively (personal preference), none of which have pockets, and I never have any issues carrying my USB stick, Swiss army knife (not mocking your example, I’d be lost without mine), voltage tester, USB cables, soldering iron, and solder.  I’ll give you the high heels thing. I’m not much for government regulation, but those things should be banned by law due to the foot, leg, and back damage they cause. Here’s the vibe I’m getting from your comment: Nothing should be pink because pink is so “stereotypically girly” (fun fact: The colors use to be opposite. Pink use to be the masculine color and blue was the feminine color), a woman has to choose between being feminine and being taken seriously, technology should be restricted by gender, and, for some odd reason, blonde women shouldn’t wear ponytails. That’s just as sexist as you claim Computer Engineer Barbie is. Other than my USB sticks, one of which is grey and black and the other of which looks like a large caliber rifle cartridge, everything I have is pink. If I can’t find it in pink and I can do so without compromising the electrical components I paint it pink because I like pink. No one is going to shame me into burning my pink clothes, painting my pink objects, and changing my favorite color just because it’s “a stereotype forced on us by ‘the patriarchy.’” Unless I show up topless, with my skirt pulled up around my head, or in a bathing suit my clients couldn’t care less how I dress. They don’t hire me because I dress like the 40s never ended. Repeat clients wouldn’t fire me if I showed up in jeans and a t shirt. They hire me because they hear good things about me. They continue to give me their business because they like my work. We’ve won that battle. Women can walk down the street dressed like men (sometimes literally. My mother and ex-girlfriend both buy their casual clothes in the men’s department because they fit better) and no one will bat an eye. We can walk down the street wearing skirts and dresses and no one will bat an eye. Men, put on a dress, go out for a while, and see how that works out for you. I honestly fail to see how demanding that Barbie dress less androgynous for a computer engineer job is any less sexist than the days when men forbade us from wearing slacks and short sleeves.

Not only did they confuse data recovery with computer engineering (there IS some overlap between the two when it comes to recovering failed storage), but they also confused software enginerring with computer engineering (she’s attempting to program a game). And even worse: She admits that she isn’t even programming it, she’s just designing it and she’s going to call in her boy toy to program it for her…she does absolutely no engineering whatsoever. Only nontechnical design work. Typical Barbie.   Reply   John Williams   November 17, 2014 Just designing? Designing software that is usable and useful takes quite a bit of skill and understanding both of how programming works and of how people work. I don’t think there is anything wrong with her being a Software Program Manager other than the fact that the author clearly doesn’t know the difference between a PM, a SE and a computer engineer (as you pointed out)   Reply   Jane   November 18, 2014 You MIGHT be able to make an argument that she’s doing software engineering, but I got the impression her role is more akin to high-level development of the requirements, rather than anything at the software level.   Reply   Jane   November 18, 2014 In fact, the closest she gets to engineering anything is stating that she’s writing a game, then corrects herself and says that she’s just writing up what she wants it to be, and that she’s going to let her boyfriends do the heavy lifting. Menz to the rescue, I guess. So much for empowerment.   Reply   John Williams   November 18, 2014 This is true. I have to say that I did as someone who works in software engineering like the idea that she wasn’t making the game by herself.  The idea of people collaborating on a project is more realistic.  However, I can fully get with the vibe that for a story that is specifically aimed at young girls for the purposed of getting them interested in STEM work that the fact that she was doing the non technical “design” work and then handed it to the two boys to program is the wrong story to tell. I think it would have worked better if she even talked about how her designs told them how to program it, but even so removing the boys altogether or even having it be a boy and a girl who did the programing would have helped keep the story on message.

As a librarian, I have an issue with the book suggesting that they take the corrupted drive to the library and plug it into the library computers there.

Reply   Cloud   November 17, 2014 They typically pair one “not traditionally a girl thing” with one “traditionally a girl thing” in these books. Oh God, I can’t believe I know that. But here’s the thing. Some girls are into Barbies. I happen to be the mother to two of them. That doesn’t mean they won’t also grow up to be scientists or software engineers. I was a Barbie-loving little girl and I grew up to be a scientist, and then a database designer, and now… eh, it’s complicated. The problem (in my view) with this book isn’t that it is Barbie or that it is pairing software engineering with some other less stereotype-busting career choice, but that it gets the story so wrong that it ends up reinforcing the stereotypes it was trying to bust.   Reply   Michelle   November 17, 2014 This is Barbie we’re talking about.  I wouldn’t have expected the content of a Barbie book to be anything other than lots of pink, ditziness, and Barbie being considered fabulous…  otherwise, it would be like buying a Playboy magazine and being upset that the naked women aren’t the photographer.   Reply   TechieMan   November 18, 2014 While I agree that this book is just terrible, I do take offense at one of your statements: “Steven and Brian represent the tech industry assumption that only men make meaningful contributions.” Maybe it’s just your experience, or assumption, that the industry feels this way but that it no way makes it a fact. In 15 years in the industry I have NEVER seen such an assumption, and I’ve always had females as parts of the teams I work on.  The only times I even hear such statements is in the media, not in the industry.  My current position has 2 females out of 5, and both of them are great at what they do. NO ONE CARES what sex you are, only what you bring to the table.  That’s the only thing that matters, not sex, not race, not religion, and most of the time not even formal education.  What can you bring to the team, nothing else matters.   Reply   Misc   November 18, 2014 “In 15 years in the industry I have NEVER seen such an assumption” We have no doubt you don’t see it. Your statement is definitely true. So is hers, though. “NO ONE CARES what sex you are, only what you bring to the table.” Some do. Who are you to say otherwise? “Maybe it’s just your experience, or assumption, that the industry feels this way” That’s the answer we get EVERY TIME we point out such occurrence. “It’s a single occurrence! An exception! Your personal experience, not a general issue!” These experiences add up. The sheer number of them demonstrates it is indeed a general issue.

Asking her teacher how to do something and then having her male friends help her do it? And the last line actually made me shudder. “I guess I can be a computer engineer!” That means she doubted it, or she still doubts it, or she’s really not that interested, or all of the above.

Reply   Saturn   November 18, 2014 Ignoring the obvious technical issues with the book, which some like to dwell on, let us look at what you viewed as a problem: Barbie worked with men on her project instead of doing it all by herself.  Software development is complicated and large projects are done easier by groups.  Being a school project it probably had a very short deadline.  Barbie specialized in the design portion of the project.  That is just as important as writing code or doing the testing.  I applaud she didn’t go “lone wolf” as that mentality is the worst to have as it always leads to problems.  Everyone in the biz knows of the stinky guy in the dark corner who chugs out code.  Team work.  It is important even if those in your team have a different sexual organ in their pants.   Reply   M. Lives   November 19, 2014 #1. Gender =/= genitalia, or “sexual organ in their pants” #2. Gender stereotypes are real and pernicious and just pretending they don’t exist (along with gender, apparently), doesn’t make them evaporate. Women are constantly stereotyped as incompetent, particularly in tech fields. A book for children which reinforces the stereotype (the incompetent female main character having to get help from men to do ANYTHING) is dangerous and has “real world” consequences, as the experiences of the other women commented on this post alone show. You might work in “the biz” but if you think “team work” is other people doing all the work (the men folk in Barbie’s life) and someone else getting all the credit (Barbie) is what this nonsense book is about, I’m hoping I never work with you and/or that you learn to listen to female team members and their experiences with sexism and stereotypes.

It’s typical of the schizophrenia Mattel have had with Barbie over the years, eg. in 1959 she’s a 17 year old that babysits but also wears a sheer nightie and negligee and high heel mules (even if she also has a stuffed toy dog with it!)

I’m not sexist, but girls, expecially pretty girls, are dumb as rocks. If they don’t do well in the tech industry, it is because they aren’t working hard enough. I’m not sexist, but I’m sick of all the whining about sexism. By the way, did I mention that I most definitely am not sexist?” Confidential to PtB: Let me tell you something man-to-man. As a computer professional, the women I’ve seen in this field have worked twice as hard to get the same respect. Telling them to “get over it” and “work on your code” is not just insulting, it’s showing your ignorance. We males have privilege in this society that we never asked for. We can act like jerks about it or we can, and I use the phrase intentionally, we can be men about it. Let’s recognize that yes, while we worked hard to get where we are, there are other people who’s hard work is being ignored because of their gender. I believe that part of being a “man” means being strong enough to admit that sexism is real and we’ve likely benefited from it. That’s not our fault. But we will be to blame if we don’t open our eyes to it and try to make things right.   Reply   Prettier than Barbie   November 23, 2014 Dear Ben FYI I am a woman.

Do they come up with covers for these books and then figure the real work is done and have an intern shit out a draft for the actual content? And while it may be true that it will go faster if Brian and Steven help, how about saying “Three heads are better than one,” and making sure Barbie makes a meaningful contribution to the effort, and either Brian or Steven or both should be changed to a girl while we’re talking about fixing this.

As a father to a 7 year old daughter, I feel very much the same as you.  Without a doubt, this is a waste of paper and resources that I would want no girl to ever partake in – they deserve more. As it is, my wife and I do not buy into (figuratively or literally) the whole Barbie/princess thing.  We want our daughter to be an independent, strong, smart woman who doesn’t need a “knight in shining armor” to come to her rescue. In addition, I am also an IT professional.  I strive to treat my co-workers equally, whatever gender they might be.  As such, I couldn’t help but find it insulting on a different level; our profession is difficult, frustrating, and requires a lot of diligent focus to succeed…Barbie’s actions in the book casts a not only insensitive shadow over all women who have struggled for equality, but there’s that tone that makes it seem like any idiot can be a computer “engineer” (yay!), even if it means mindlessly using people and being ignorantly dishonest by taking credit for other people’s work – which drives me INSANE. Now, the role of Brian and Steven.  There are people in this industry who really do just want to help.  It would have been great if one of those two were girls, or hell, a transgender.  But, good, honest guys do exist that want to help, because being human is more important than being a self-righteous male.  Unfortunately, there is no shortage of the latter – especially on the Internet. I want my daughter to feel like she can achieve anything that a man can, but even more, I want her to do it without taking advantage of others to get what she wants, but just to be an honest human being that cares about others. So, with that – a question for you: I run a site called Faildesk, where we post about humorous (or sometimes not) IT related topics – I’d like to use the Barbie pictures you posted and add my own commentary.

She engages in very little actual labor and is able to take all the credit for the final outcome of a project. She is the “brains” of the operation who can’t be bothered with doing things that aren’t interesting or require creativity. Peasants are meant to actually do something that requires training and take orders from others. She came up with the idea for the whole project, she tells everyone what the results need to be, and she takes credit for everyone else’s labor. The fact that she constantly doesn’t know actually how to code or program is a representation of her place in the leisure class. To me it looks like she is living the American Dream. Her powerful social network allows her to take credit for other people’s work. Really, she reminds me of all my (male and female) bosses. Often it seems they have networked there way into a good job, they don’t know what in the hell they are doing, but when something goes right they get the credit and when something goes wrong no dares blame them.

That said, I have to say the following: Sorry, Pamela, but this article is a load of femi-nazi poo. As someone involved in the computer industry, I can say beyond the shadow of a doubt, regardless of who you are, what gender you are, or even how good you are at your job, you will have to work as a member of a team, and thanks to the modern wonders of equal opportunity, most professional teams have BOTH genders working side by side. Some of the most highly skilled computer-related professionals I know are women and at least half of the reason they are the best is because they are invaluable as team members. Expressing that women have to work only with other women or by themselves to be considered doing something “empowering” is hypocritically sexist and fundamentally segregationist to say the least. As for this story’s use of a computer virus, gender is not a concern of a computer virus, and can be confusing to the user of the computer regardless of the user gender. Next, stating that she claimed all the credit for these things is an exaggeration. When you take the car to the mechanic and you bring it home saying “I got the car fixed.” would you expect to be hounded for taking credit the mechanic was due? And, lastly, if she actually designed a fun, playable computer game with the help of only two other people (even if they are guys, ) then as a fictional character goes, she probably could be an excellent game designer and her ending statement is not in vain. All this said, I wouldn’t expect a columnist from NPR to know just how much hard work goes into good game design.   Reply   Ken   November 20, 2014 Are you kidding me!!!! In no way shape or form does this book portraying any type of sexist views. Women who have taken offense to this need to take a step back and look at the big picture. If Ken or Skipper barbie came to help her out, then this wouldn’t be an issue. I think everybody needs to relax and take a step back and take the book for what it is worth and stop looking for hidden messages.   Reply   Prettier than Barbie   November 20, 2014 I agree 100%!!!!

Thank you for writing this.  -Brandy  brandymars.blogspot.ca   Reply   Bernie Margolis   November 20, 2014 As a software engineer I have to say that Barbie is on a path to a much more lucrative career than those saps, Steven and Brian.  With her delegation and project management skills Barbie will be heading up teams in no time.  She’ll get to take credit for all her teams’ accomplishments despite working 7 hour days with 2 hour business lunches thrown in. Steven and Brian, in the meantime, will be working 12 hour days to bring Barbie’s visions to fruition.  Since Barbie’s a generous sort she’ll make them feel good with nice performance reviews and performance bonuses that will bring their income up to a level that still falls short of her’s by about 25%. This blog post implies that Barbie is falling short of her potential, but I contend that she’s a freaking genius! Consider that the typical engineer’s day goes something like the expert’s in this sketch:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg In the meantime Barbie is on track to be more like the project manager.

Sweet feminist-Jesus, why don’t you relax. So what if Barbie’s job is designing game ideas? She’s obviously a game designer in that story. FYI, game designers need the help of programmers, graphic designers, and whatnot to make their design an actual game. Not because they are female, but because that is not their job! People are so fucking hypersensitive these days. Don’t blame all your own insecurities on another people.

Barbie is as much about pretense as for example any Rambo-type book, doll, movie or game. Or as playing Cowboys and Indians. Barbie was supposed to be about fun, trying out all the roles and costumes, with all the accessories and always majority confusing the actual work, job or accomplishment with just the way it looks. That’s what ALL Barbie stories are about. And then to select THIS booklet and analyze its reasoning while not attacking the complete Barbie brand and how all she ever did was joyfully debasing all jobs and activities as merely appearances! And as you outlined even *acting* in her other book is just “pretend acting”, with no actual work or skill in exactly the same way the story lets her pretending to be a computer engineer. But you’re not as upset about that story because it’s about a less male dominated area? And are toys like this and their books supposed to be “role models”? I don’t think so. The message is just as void and “dangerous” as playing a soldier or armed renegade is. But how many boys or girls into that ever seriously aspire to be one beyond the brief thought? That said, feel free to attack the Barbie confusion as a whole but do allow room for the make believe and pretending that comes with it. The Game does not have to make Sense or Teach us something. The Game essentially never Works that way.

Reply   Dan   November 21, 2014 It’s a bit weird that Barbie ends up being a designer rather than a computer engineer. The story could have been more aspirational and there is definitely something a bit funny about how she needs help to write the code. There are plenty of young people on Yahoo who just don’t even know they need antivirus software though. Things should also be realistic, if you had her building a new laptop and compiling Linux binaries that might be a tad OTT.   Reply   Matt   November 21, 2014 Calm down people.

Just kidding, very funny post, but I agree we are not looking at “just one story”, what you say is true, in the IT, women are expected to behave like this Barbie, sooner or later. The sad thing, being a man in the IT, is that I have been a Steven or a Brian many times, but I honestly don’t know how to avoid this from happening. I think others want to see in me the Brian who finally solved and in my female colleague the Barbie who almost fucked it up. Even when there is no evidence at all anything like that happened!

I was drawing a picture of my car, [I added flowers and butterflies to make it look prettier!] and wrote, “Vroom” under it because my real car was acting funny and it wasn’t making that “vroom” sound any more :( I told my sister that I could fix it and make it go again [because who wants to walk to the gym to exercise?]. Remembering this book, I dolled myself up and called my friend, Toby, to come over and check out what’s under my hood. Shockingly, he zipped over in record time!!! He opened the box where the engine lives and nicely lectured me about some things that… I’ve no idea what they were about… something like, “oil”, “fluids”, who knows. I showed him my freshly polished nails and skipped to my computer to see what gossip I was missing out on from doing all that hard work. While I was on the computer, I changed my portal pages theme by clicking on the ‘options’ link [yes, I'm a web designer too!]. My friend had me go outside and turn the key, and guess what?? It went “vroom” again!! After I patted him on the head, told him what a great friend he was and made him go away, I called my sister and told her all about how I fixed it and she was so impressed that she bragged to all her friends at what a capable, independent, and smart woman her big sister was. She wants to be just like me when she grows up :D I’m so flattered!!! If it wasn’t for books like this, I’d wind up just pouting until someone asked me what’s wrong and then fixes it for me. Pouting causes deep lines :( This book taught me to ASK for help from a boy rather than just waiting for one to come help me after hours of sulking. I *can* do and be anything I want!!!

She lived in Copenhagen, Denmark for more than 20 years where she worked for Microsoft Development Center Copenhagen as a editor and usability designer specializing in linguistic usability. 2) She also wrote: {quote]For Mattel’s Barbie I CAN BE website, Susan has written dialog for Barbie and her friends. She has also written 45-page Barbie books for Mattel through Egmont Creative Center Copenhagen including, Barbie ICB Computer Engineer, Barbie ICB Painter, Barbie ICB Martial Artist, Barbie ICB Tennis Player, Barbie ICB Lifeguard, Barbie ICB Artist and Barbie ICB Actress. These books are available on Amazon.de.

She proudly told me that she had solved a problem and created a machine that would allow people to drive it both on the roads and in space. She brought me a bunch of drawings she’d made of the machine. I asked her how it worked. She told me she wasn’t worried about that part, she had designed it and someone else would build it. Her words were “I thought of it, I’ll get someone else to make it and I’ll be rich!”. I won’t go into my fruitless attempts to get her excited about actually building it. Engineering was something other people would do to make her dream come true. Barbie is a piece of the problem, unfortunately there is so much else children (and we) consume in all forms of media that it’s like chipping away at a huge wall. Maybe it’s a Frozen ice wall.

Reply   MBB   November 24, 2014 How can you claim that ‘But Steven and Brian are also everything frustrating about the tech industry” , after the many ways you sum up that Barbie wronged them? Isn’t that all the more prove of Baribie’s misandry, the ‘ help’ is so easily cast aside? But more serious, while it is representive of steriotypical behaviour in the software world techies do seem to ‘do’ everything when helping guys too (because it goes faster), so I don’t think Barbie is treated differently – but that IS where the story is lacking compared to about EVERY OTHER CHILDRENS BOOK.  Most include a lesson about learning from each other – and there all the pink candy could have been a lure to teach that story with a few simple modifications. I don’t think that it’s a problem that Barbie starts of as somewhat computer-illiterate – that’s what computer class is for right? She’s on the right way.  But like you already mentioned, it would be nice if she showed some initiative. For instance when they did the first laptop, she should have made notes and asked to have things explained.  And then the second laptop, the guys (or preferably  boy and girl or two girls), should have said that they would watch, but Barbie would have to do that one herself.  And then her sister could have reasonably re-written her presentation (in the assumption that it was lost) explaining how Barbie stepped up and learned, and how more girls/people should take the opportunity to learn when it presents itself, rather then depend on others to fix it.

Is this article suggesting that we should only ask other females for help with complicated things, otherwise it’s insulting? Isn’t that misandric? And barbie is obviously still in school so the book implies she’s still learning. Being ignorant of something and asking for help isn’t insulting, it’s encouraging. It may have come out like a misogynistic book, but I really doubt that was in their minds when they made it. But I never let my kid play with barbie things anyway, so I suppose it doesn’t matter on my end.   Reply   David   November 27, 2014 Pamie,  I totally get why you’re exasperated, at the least, with this book.  The upside down part though… Not really as much of an issue.  I have some older Sci-fi books that were printed that way.  Two novels in one paperback, printed upside down to each other.  The rest though, I don’t get how some people don’t see that the author made Barbie totally incompetent at what she was supposed to be studying.  It would’ve been fine to as for help because something, like the programming, wasn’t working.  Not even being capable of it as a CE student, though?  Not realistic at all.   Reply   Ian Sinclair   November 28, 2014 There is a plethora of editorial sound and fury about “including” women in STEM fields, and equal column-inches about making STEM firms more “diverse”… yet in the final, reductive, HONEST analysis, it all distills down to… CODDLING.  i.e. if those “evil patriarchs” who (for some “strange” reason) dominate STEM fields, would only treat adult females and adult minorities as sensitive traumatized 8-year-old foster children, THEN these “excluded” folks will excel in intellectually rigorous math-intensive endeavors.  At least that’s the gospel. Oh snap, the irony of feminists lobbying for widespread PATRONization… is this perhaps the biggest outrage of all? Three words to use as your STEM Reality Check:  Apollo Moon Program!  No coddling, no excuses, no sensitivity training, no “outreach” programs, just STELLAR RESULTS!   Reply   Mr. Miller   December 1, 2014 Both the concept of the book and the content are wrong. Firstly, several of the events and facts mentioned, are wrong.  Security software only protects against well established virii, as anti-virus only protects against virii that it has previous definition of.  If just plugging the flash drive in, causes the virii to spread to her sisters computer, then it is transferring by using windows Autoplay, autorun.inf or autoexec.bat.  Which means, plugging in the hard drive to a computer with “security software” won’t really prevent anything bad from happening, unless Autoplay is disbled.  Which most security software does not do (because turning off autoplay prevents install cds from properly loading up). In this situation,  you use another operating system to access the files.  And it can be done on the same computer.  (minwin, puppy linux, etc) This is due to how executable files, windows, and virii, work. The subject matter is actually, way too complex to summarize, and get the whole concept across, let alone to a child. As far as her “needing” help from Steven and Brian.  Who really gives a shit that the two other people on her team, are men.  That is sexist right there, the thinking that her team CANNOT have men involved.  Any Development team, will consist of various members, and hey, guess what.  Most Devs are men.  Get over it, she is most likely working with men to complete a program. The Designer is in charge of the GUI (graphical user interface), and overall how the users interaction should feel.  They do not program, in most cases.  That not sexist, its how the industry works, it compartmentalizes these things because they are complex and time consuming. There is no “I”, in team.  Even if your a feminist. Most programs ARE NOT written by one person.  I would say 99.999% of the programs a person ever uses are that way, video games especially.  Most are written by hundreds, or thousands, and occasionally tens of thousands of people will be involved.  (yes, that many) And, yes, there will be men involved.  Like it or not, we are a part of this species too. The fact the author would be shamed for having men involved, is as sexist as shaming her for having women involved. Double standards are sickening, and anyone applying sexism and double standards, should be the ones being ashamed. So…  The author knows very little about IT, that is one issue.  Misinformation should NEVER be how we teach our children, it just leads to confusing them. Just like using “baby-talk” with babies.  Your children will speak much more quickly if you just talk to them like normal.  Don’t confuse the things before they even get a start in life. The second issue I find, is with the fact that there is an assumption that females SHOULD be in the tech field.  No, there is nothing wrong with a woman in the IT field.  And God knows, as someone with over a decade in the tech field, doing everything from programming, to Network engineering, I would have loved less monotony and more effeminate roles in the workplace.  To undo some tedium and monotony, and give difference of perspective, and interesting conversation. The IT world is ridden with both, tedium, and monotony… Truth be told, most women, naturally do not like technical fields.  In science we call this: Sexual Dimorphism, a phenotypic difference between males and females of the same species. phenotype:  the observable properties of an orgamism that are produced by the interaction of the genotype and the environment. That is just copy-paste definitions, any arguments can be pointed at Merriam Webster. That is why a womans brain chemistry is more relaxed while talking, and a mans is more relaxed during silence. Along with thousands upon thousands, of other interesting facts that make us different, that we were not sat down and taught, but are rather there because of they are how we are born. Inherent differences found in our genes themselves. Yes that is right, its not sexist.  Its genetic.  And its proven, accepted, scientific fact.  Women and men naturally do what they want to do, its in their genes.  Men generally are more logos, women are generally more ethos. It doesn’t make one sex better, but it gives us both roles.  Yes, some people break the mold, and always will.  But they will do it naturally. Your more likely to convince someone to break that mold, by restricting them from it, than endorsing it.  Anyone that argues this, never had to deal with a child, and never used reverse psychology.  (which works unless the kid figures out your using reverse psychology, smart little buggers.) This is why Amelia Earhart was a big deal.  No one gave her a book saying, hey, big sister is study’n to be a pilot! (with a bunch of technobabble thrown in)  She broke the mold, because it was what she wanted.  It was what came natural to her. So how about this.  How about instead of trying to force anyone into any specific role.  We allow them to flourish at what they want to do, and we don’t throw misinformation at them in the process. We could start by halting the lies scattered through the learning process.  Like Christopher Columbus discovered america (he never stepped a foot on North American soil, look it up.  He was a slaver and a horribly evil man, stop celebrating him please.  He owned a book from the 14th century that discussed how the world was round.  Him discovering the earth wasn’t flat is also a lie…). Anyways… How about we question why our children are lied to so much?  And then teach our children to question everything, and learn with a sincerity and passion for what they want to do. The entire education system is absolutely garbage!  Anyone arguing such only happens with those living in a cave.  Its a high stress, non productive habitat. It bores our intelligent children, and puts harsh roadblocks and restrictions on children without such a positive predisposition on learning. We should be teaching these kids about having passion for learning, and then watching them take off in their own direction. I myself, grew up without a computer.  Yet here I am, working on them every day.  Enjoying doing so. Why are we telling these kids “You can be whatever you want to be when you grow up!”.  And then shoving them in McDonalds for their first job, and watching them struggle with 50 different majors until get a degree in arts, and are still confused about what to do with themselves as their loans default and their options disappear. The real question adults should be asking, isn’t “Why are our schools failing?”.  The real question is, “Why are we failing our children?”. There are several TED talks about this, as well as several good books.  The education system needs to be torn down, and changed into something this newer generation needs. Which is simply a place for our children to develop themselves.  Not just how to do math well.  Or read well.  But how to understand human interaction well.  We need these kids to understand the importance of tolerance.  The importance of curiosity. Esp.  The american culture needs to be developed to something more important than cowboys and indians, or gangsters and cops.  This book doesn’t teach little girls that working with tech is cool, it teaches them to alienate barbie as a woman that is different from themselves in a way that alienates her. And then it enforces it with misinformation… This is the difference between feeding someone fish, and teaching someone to fish. And to this, the author is thankfully, headed in the right direction!  For which I am thankful for.  She is trying to get young girls to be curious about technology. This is what our schools should be doing! But seriously though, why the big push for a stronger education of women in a society that has 2 women in college to every 1 man.  That is sexist and wrong. There was a grant programmed opened for white men last year, that was SHUT DOWN by lawsuits from the NAACP.  White men are quickly becoming the LEAST educated grouping because of such. And no, its not good when ANY group is treated this way.  White men are not any more responsible for the sins of their fathers than anyone else.  (or mothers for that matter.) If we want equality, make it equal, don’t just keep tipping the scales. There is something thoroughly messed up with this picture. And to anyone, still spouting about feminism.  Please, for the good of both genders, stop. Feminism is feeding an IN-equality movement.  If you want equality, be a egalitarian.  Any time you push for more power for one gender/sex/religion, you are doing nothing but power-mongering for yourself, your views, and your side of the spectrum. Doing so puts you in ranks with every other group that has done so.  KKK, Black Panthers, Nazi’s, Crusaders, etc, etc.  It is never an awesome thing to power-monger for one side.  Ever.  It always starts off good, but once the scales tip, the goal remains the same, the scales tip the other direction, and all hell breaks loose. All people should be equal, regardless of our disposition to naturally do one thing or another. How about we get ALL kids excited about IT, programming, and computer related fields.  And see where children go with it.  Why does it have to be a gender thing?  Isn’t doing that, in and of itself, sexist as hell? If feminists are so concerned with equality, why are they so concerned that she happens to work with two guys on her program, for which is in charge of design? Sorry, but by being upset by that, your sexist as hell.  Looking to hard at something for an inequality that IS NOT THERE. Perhaps if the feminist movement was more fixated on equality than gender, it would equate to more than my bowel movement, and be at least as productive as one. Looking forward to the book where barbie teaches stacey how being an egalitarian isn’t sexist, but being a feminist very much so is.   Reply   Sterling W.   December 8, 2014 Nice website, Pamela!

While ideas are a dime a dozen, if you know what you want but don’t know how to make it you generally ask people who know how to do what you don’t to help you out, and if you know the people and it’s an idea you’re passionate about you don’t generally hold out for someone else just because your first choice has a Y chromosome. Those parts about Skipper make it seem like you’re just looking for things to get irritated at. She pours her big sister a glass of juice so suddenly she’s Donna Stone? And her hitting Barbie with a pillow is sexist how? It’s what kids do. In reality she probably would have hit her out of anger and the pillow would have just been the closest object, but I’m sure they had to add that “playfully” in to avoid sending the message that it’s acceptable to lash out like that when you’re angry. I use to hit my brothers and cousin with pillows, my cousin use to hit me with pillows, and with my cousin it never degenerated into the stereotypical slumber party scenario where we sat around in our nighties doing each other’s hair and talking about boys. Her teacher told her what to do to recover the files, but she didn’t tell her how to do it. It’s not quite as simple as just plugging a hard drive into another computer. It didn’t go faster with the guys helping because they’re guys, it went faster because they probably had experience, either in more advanced classes (she met them after class so they may have classes in common but they’ve already been through that course) or through personal experience. Yes, she could have done it herself, just like I did it myself, but it would have gone a lot faster if my brother, who happens to be a guy and more knowledgeable about it than I (he majored in comp sci while I teach myself on the internet) did it for me because he wouldn’t have spent all that time messing around with jumpers and running to our parents’ house to look something up online. You seem to be concerned about what kind of message this book would send to your daughter. The question is, what kind of message to YOU want to send to your daughter? When she’s an adult do you want her to stand there helpless because her phone (along with the GPS) is down and the only one who seems to know how to get where she’s going doesn’t have the requisite number of X chromosomes? Do you want her living without water because her pipes burst, she doesn’t know anything about plumbing, and the only people in her circle of friends who knows how to fix the pipes are men? Or because she can’t find a female plumber in the Yellow Pages? I’m not at all ashamed to ask men for help if they know what they’re doing. It’s not admitting that my boobs make me incompetent in that area. It’s admitting that I lack the knowledge (and since no one has time to learn everything we all have areas we’re ignorant in) and one of the guys I know might know something about it. While I fix the water lines around here (often I can optimize the areas I’m replacing so I quite enjoy it) because my girlfriend can’t tell a pipe saw from a hack saw, I have no issue calling our boyfriend to rescue me from a leaking sewer pipe (her lack of knowledge and my lack of desire to work with sewage). She has no issue calling our boyfriend to fix her water lines before calling me. I don’t ask our boyfriend to fix the sewer line because he’s a man. I ask him to fix it because I know he knows how to do it and I don’t want to do it. My girlfriend doesn’t show preference to our boyfriend when it comes to her water lines because he’s a man. She calls him first because she wants the leak stopped and the water back on in half an hour, not the leak stopped, the whole system optimized (removing unnecessary joints (the more joints you have, the more potential leaks), etc), and the water back on in three hours. Simply put, if your daughter doesn’t know how to do something when she’s older and it outrages you that she asks men for help then you, frankly, will be an idiot. I’m surprised you didn’t also make a race issue out of it, because it’s entirely possible for one person to do the programming but she required two, one who happens to be African-American. Isn’t that sending the message that a black man can be helpful, but only if he’s working with two white people? My grandmother, who was a feminist to the extent of making you look like a 1950s suburban housewife (and also participated and helped organize civil rights marches in the 50s), probably would have been livid over that while shrugging off the alleged “sexism” in this book.   Reply   randomvisitor   December 25, 2014 This was made on the feet based on usb drives being the most common source of infection. It fails fouriatingly when explaining that plugging a admin-installed poisoned file should be plugged in a endpoint in behind a hardened gate, even more if its not the own network to be f-ed up. Wonder why the guys met her the afternoon and she only returned to her flatshare with the sister the next morning – after meeting in hookup central, the bibliotheque where every prudent programmer would go and which installed software he`d trust to handle a unkown file – in a system that must be safe since the guys as students have admin rights to install forensic and recovery tools?  There is more than one “wrong” message being send with this, but likely the author understood only firewall as sole virus protection available so downloading on the infected machine would have worked if the removal tools where good enough to remove a combined virus/worm/blining-screen-message convolute the system ingeneer had agreed to install on her backup drive neclace…. The black guy sitting in class appears to be an afterthought, the desk position s off and the guy at 2 o`clock could not even reach his desk if he had sat there at the beginning of this being drafted.   Reply   John Kennard   February 25, 2015 (1) Hilarious, hot and well-deserved takedown. A classic. VWD. (2) Don’t all the cool kids use *NIX live-disks on flash-drives for de-borking micro systems nowadays? (3) Aren’t you a little hard on Steven and Brian (and others here on the librarian)? Everybody in town undoubtedly knows and is wary of the notoriously-wealthy Mattel family and their equally-notoriously differently-mentated progeny, and Steven and Brian (and librarian) were equally-undoubtedly trying to minimize the damage. (4) Yes, Barbie taking credit for others’ work is as morally problematic here as the virism. (5) Mattel marketing non-sexist, socially-conscious Barbies and Barbie-books is about as convincing as would be Playboy running a “NOW Member of the Month”. Mattel and Barbie are evil. Children should make their own dolls or “action figures” and accessories. (6) I personally would forgive Mattel everything if they would come out with the philosopher Hiaasen’s suggested double-jointed vampire Barbies. Apologies for the late hit.

We’re passionate about making it easier for you to cook delicious, nutritious meals (using fresh ingredients) from scratch on a regular basis – it’s better for you, your family, and even the planet! But we know that your busy schedule makes it more difficult. So, we operate as a subscription to take all of the hard bits - meal planning and shopping - away. We just leave you to do the fun bit – cooking and eating with your loved ones! What's more, by placing consistent weekly orders with our independent  suppliers , they can provide you with the best quality produce for a  price comparable with equivalent supermarket  with equivalent supermarket fare. It’s a win-win! But in some corners, subscriptions have got a bad rep. Confusing contracts, hidden terms and unwanted extras. That’s why we operate as a   flexible subscription   - meaning there is no minimum term, and you can change your deliveries to fit in with your hectic lifestyle. On holiday or busy next week? You’re the boss! Simply place your account on pause using our flexible order calendar by Wednesday at 6pm the week prior. To find out more,  managing subscriptions .     Is there a minimum subscription length?  Our service is designed to offer flexibility and convenience so you can manage when you would like your deliveries. There is no minumum delivery, just remember to update your account before 7pm on Wednesday the week before your next delivery with any changes.      How do I deactivate my subscription?  Deactivating your subscription is easy. You just need to go to your  account  area and follow these steps:                          1. Go to  My Orders  on the menu to the left  2. Choose the subscription you'd like to deactivate and click it  3. Select the edit button at the top of  My Subscriptions  4. Click on ' Deactivate my subscription '  5. Follow the steps to deactivate        Can l change my box?  Like the look of a different box? You can always upgrade your box for the following week, just head to “my orders” and you can alter the number of meals or the number of people you want your box for. Just remember to complete the update by Wednesday at 6pm the week before your next delivery.      What happens on Bank Holidays?  In order to ensure that we keep sending you the very best ingredients and that our hard working  suppliers  get a well-earned break, our Monday nationwide deliveries, 9am to 5pm, will be delivered on Tuesday between 9am to 6pm.    Meals     Can I choose my meals?  At The HelloFresh Farm we always encourage a bit of adventure and we want to help you expand your culinary repertoire. Discovering delicious food is one of the things that makes HelloFresh so great, that is why we have introduced “Meal Swap” on our 3 meal classic boxes. By logging on, and heading to “Meal Swap” you can deselect a meal you don’t want, and swap it for one you do. Just remember you can only swap one meal. If you need any more information,  just head to   swapsies        Can I see my meals and what's coming up?  Our upcoming recipes are updated on our homepage every Thursday, and you can also find them on the  'Upcoming Recipes'  section, which you can find under ‘Recipes’. If you want to see our recent menus, just head to  ‘Recipe Archive’ .      Do you offer vegetarian plans?  Yes! We offer a  vegetarian HelloFresh box  which includes 3 tasty vegetarian meals per week. Unfortunately, meal swap is not currently available on our vegetarian boxes.     Do you offer plans for people with special dietary requirements?  Whilst we don't offer specific dietary plans, because our ingredients are delivered to you in separate packets, if you have any specific dislikes you can simply omit or replace them with your own ingredients. You can learn more about the  ingredients  we use in the About HelloFresh section.     Do you offer plans for singles?   We have many single-person households as customers who chose the 3-meal plan for 2 people and gain eternal popularity with their friends, or simply tuck in to any remaining food from their meals later in the week. Everything in our boxes, except for prawns, is perfectly safe to freeze for a later date.      Why is HelloFresh a healthy choice?  Cooking with fresh  ingredients  helps you stay healthy and beats any type of convenience food, frozen food or fast food. By preparing your meals with fresh  ingredients  you ensure that important nutrients aren't lost. In addition, we create our  recipes  to ensure a healthy diet. Since our chefs and nutritionists create and select  recipes  on a weekly basis, they are able to ensure that your diet is balanced and provides all the nutrients you need for a healthy lifestyle.     Do you provide nutritional information?  Every recipe card lists the calories, saturated fat, carbohydrates and protein. You can also view these for your upcoming meals by heading to  ‘Recipes’ .      How do you calculate your nutritional information?  All of our nutritional information is determined by a calculation method. In other words we use the nutritional properties of the raw ingredients in our recipe and calculate the amount of nutritional value they have in aggregate, this does not include the oil, pepper or salt that may be added in the cooking process.  Our recipe cards provide information on the amount of calories, carbohydrate, protein and saturated fat. If you would like anymore information just get in touch with us anytime.

We now deliver across the U.K.! To confirm that we can deliver to your address, enter your postcode at the checkout. Exceptions include islands off the coast of mainland U.K. and the Scottish Highlands.     When do you deliver?  We deliver once per week on a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or a Thursday. If you live within the M25, we can deliver between 5pm and 9pm on a Sunday, Monday or Tuesday, or, you can choose the 9am to 5pm slot on a Monday, Tuesday or Thursday. For all other areas, your delivery will arrive between 9am and 5pm on Monday, Tuesday or Thursday. Don't worry if you're not in - we use state-of-the-art packaging to ensure your box remains fresh until you come home later in the evening.    Why can't I choose my delivery time?  All our routes are carefully planned each week based on the deliveries we have to make. We do this to reduce our carbon emissions, and also to find the quickest route possible.      What if I am not at home to accept the delivery?  When checking-out, you can provide us with instructions on what to do if you're not at home to accept your delivery. In fact, most of our customers are not present when we deliver their food. Some customers simply ask us to leave their HelloFresh box in front of their door. Others tell us to take their box to a helpful neighbour or the porter in their building. Whatever your personal circumstances, our friendly drivers will do their best to find a way to make HelloFresh work for you.     Will the contents of my box remain fresh if I'm not in to accept the delivery?  Don't worry if you're not in - all of our boxes are packaged using specialty insulation and environmentally friendly cooling agents in order to keep your groceries fresh (whatever the weather), provided you are able to transfer the contents to your fridge on the evening of your delivery.  Making the Most of your Box    Can I recycle my packaging?  We’re on a mission to reduce our carbon footprint so we’ve partnered up with Collect+ for you to send back any unwanted packaging. Your wool liners and spice pots are biodegradable so can be added straight into your compost. Boxes and brown bags can be recycled like your normal items at home, but wool liners and ice packs can be reused in more HelloFresh boxes - so please send them back to the HelloFresh farm. To download your pre-post label head to  our recycling page      What are you doing to reduce waste?  We’ve partnered up with  Love Food Hate Waste , to help us on our mission to reduce food waste. We only ever order the exact quantities needed for our deliveries each week, so we’re not throwing away tonnes of extra food. We’re also helping all our customers to reduce the food waste in their homes, by only giving you the ingredients you need to make your meals, in the exact quantities.    Will the groceries stay fresh for a week?  Everything that goes into your box is carefully selected and hand-packed, as though you were doing the shopping. Our recipes are created using  ingredients  that stay fresh long enough for you to enjoy them in the week you have received them, as long as they are stored correctly. If we include  ingredients  that need to be used sooner rather than later (such as fish) we suggest that you prepare them at the beginning of the week. However, we would always advise you to use your own judgement so you can guarantee the best from all your meals.     What's the best way of storing my herbs?  Chives, Thyme and Rosemary should be stored in the warmest section of your fridge wrapped in plastic. Basil, Parsley and Coriander should be treated like a bouquet of flowers. Just trim the ends and place in a small glass of water at room temperature, and outside of direct sunlight.     How do you work out your measurements?  We have moved towards volume measurements to help you get a better feel of your ingredients. If you need a helping hand  head here     Which ingredients do you assume I have at home?  All you need to have available at home is salt, pepper, white sugar, a good cooking oil and butter. We'll give you the rest.  Vouchers and Gift Boxes    How can I redeem my voucher?  All you need to do is head to our Homepage and select the box you want to order. Follow the steps through the checkout, and add your voucher code to the box marked ‘Coupon’. Just make sure your discount is deducted and hit Checkout.  Please remember only one voucher is valid per customer.     I have a voucher code, why are you charging me £1?  As HelloFresh is a weekly delivery service we need to ensure that the payment details are correct for any subsequent deliveries.  Initially £1 will be taken from your account to validate the payment.  This process is to validate that the card is correct and for us to process an order for you. This £1 is automatically refunded back to you.     Why isn't my voucher code working?  Check that your code is correct, and that you are ordering the correct box. Vouchers won’t apply to one-off boxes such as HelloFresh gift boxes. If you’re still having trouble, just drop a line to our  customer service team .     Can I order HelloFresh as a gift?  Most definitely! Just choose the type and size of box you want to give, and order this through the checkout. We'll send you a gift voucher via e-mail to download and print, and order through us, when they want. If you want to learn more head to  our Gift Box page     How do I redeem my HelloFresh gift box?  Simply pick the date you want to receive your box, and then get in touch with your unique gift code, and delivery information. We’ll sort out the rest.   And just in case you were wondering...   How does Patrick get his hair so shiny?  The office has been dying to know this for ages, but it’s his best-kept secret. We reckon it must be some sort of conditioner or DIY hair mask. Maybe that’s why all the avocado and honey from the Fresh Farm have been disappearing…    I love speaking to Ellie on the phone, her voice always sounds so soothing! How does she stay relaxed at work?  Ellie loves cats. Especially from Greece.   View boxes!

For Radiotopia - and all of radio - to be the best it can be, we need to find even more people who are not currently on our radar.  So we have a big idea.  At $600,000, Radiotopia will create a pilot development fund  to find new, talented producers and hosts. We will specifically seek out new voices to pilot programs that tackle subjects not well covered in traditional public media.  Quality will always be our first criteria. I believe diversity of people and perspectives is the key component to quality that’s too often neglected in media.  We are interested in producers who pilot their own program, as well as contribute stories to existing Radiotopia shows.  Bringing in new voices and broadening the audience are critical steps in remaking public radio. Our collective of shows is already proving that incredible talent exists in unexpected places, and that we have a knack for finding it.  If you believe in this mission, kick in another buck or two, or just spread the word. ***The Hover 20,000 Backer Challenge*** We did it! Thank you so much for being one of the 20,000 and helping us get the extra $25,000 from Hover. Look what we did together!      "[A] kind of Justice League for smart documentarians and sound artists." -- Bill McKibben This is Radiotopia. I'm Roman Mars. Radiotopia   became a reality  in November 2013, when I called on the backers of the last 99% Invisible campaign to fund "a new kind of public radio." Radio full of the most compelling stories imaginable, made by a group of talented creators combining their energies to grow their audiences and thrive.  People - probably many of you - rallied beyond our wildest dreams. It was an awe-inspiring moment, the realization that the heart of a radio fan can grow to make room for many deserving shows. Together with  PRX , we’ve taken that love, trust, and money to bring together a collective of the best storytelling shows on the planet.  99% Invisible  Fugitive Waves  Love + Radio  Radio Diaries  Strangers  Theory of Everything  The Truth  These shows make you laugh, cry, cringe, remember, reflect, strive, despair, relax... everything.  As if that weren’t enough, as members of Radiotopia, they are reimagining radio from broadcast to digital, and the life of a creator from starving to sustainable. Radiotopia is bringing a listener-first, creator-driven ethos to public radio.  In just a few months, we have built a true collective of indie producers who share editorial, business, and emotional resources. It’s not just an amazing group of podcasts, it’s an amazing group of people. And we’re getting somewhere:  The Radiotopia Network has increased downloads by 165% since our launch nine months ago.  Two shows have more than quadrupled their audience.  99% Invisible, which had the biggest audience to begin with, has grown by 135%.         The dream is alive,  but our work here is far from done .  To take it to the next level, we need you. Podcasts need about  50,000 downloads per episode  for some measure of financial sustainability. Radiotopia wants our existing shows to blow through that number. That takes more gear, more staff, more travel, more branding and promotion. Our shows are not just two people chatting in front of microphone (not that there's anything wrong with that - I love a lot of those shows); they are skillfully crafted, sound-rich productions. That commitment to craft requires a lot of time and resources. Your Kickstarter pledge will support all the shows in Radiotopia and ensure that all of us will continue to produce our best work. We also want to invite more shows into Radiotopia. A win-win-win for us, for deserving creators, and for you, our fans and listeners.  Your support will make that happen.        The Rewards  Radiotopia Ringtones All the shows in Radiotopia are contributing to a set of awesome and awesomely weird ringtones/alert tones. Sample:    Strangers Pen-Pal Letterhead Print-your-own Strangers letterhead and gain a stranger pen-pal, assigned to you by Lea. (Pen-pal part is optional.) Both letterhead AND the pen-pal are included at all levels $10 and above.     Strangers digital letterhead, comes with pen-pal (if you want one).    Melodium: 99 Digital LP Melodium (Laurent Girard) has inspired and scored more of 99pi's radio stories than any other artist. Girard has created an exclusive, new digital album just for this Kickstarter, called "Melodium: 99." Sample track:    Love + Radio Remix album New electronic music sourced from past L+R episodes and made into something wondrous.

(Not the final cover, but close)    99% Invisible Producer for a day Pick from a couple dozen potential days (we'll make something work) and we'll invite you into the 99% Invisible production. You'll sit in on a story meeting, critique whatever rough draft we have in process, go out to lunch (probably for pho, we love pho), and just hang out all day. You just need to get yourself to Oakland. Check out the sidebar for lots of other great rewards, such as lunch with the Kitchen Sisters, Theory of Everything, or Radio Diaries, online mentoring sessions, live events and so much more!     Risks and challenges  Radiotopia "Season 2" is scheduled to start February 3, 2015 and end in January 2016.  We are a collective of individually owned and operated programs, so each of us have individual challenges and goals. As such, it's hard to achieve milestones at the same rate and produce results on the same timeline. Of course, a lot of these risks would be mitigated by us raising a record-setting amount of funds and we can all devote all our energy solely to our radio shows! That sounds like a good idea.  Reward fulfillment is always a tough challenge for a small group that specializes in making radio, not shipping t-shirts, but we've partnered with people who are experts at getting merchandise to your door.  Learn about accountability on Kickstarter      FAQ        Where do I select my t-shirt size, color, etc.?     After the campaign is over, you will receive an email survey from Kickstarter in which you will select your t-shirt choices, sizes and colors and fill in your mailing address. Once that survey is returned to us, we will start the fulfillment process.  Last updated: Sun, Oct 19 2014 5:54 pm EDT         I already backed the project, am I a part of the 20,000 backer challenge? Can I back again?     All the backers count toward the challenge (even before we announced it) so you've already done your part. You can't back twice, but please encourage your spouse, your parents, your kids to pledge even a small amount so we can reach our 20,000 backer goal.
