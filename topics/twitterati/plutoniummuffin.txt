There is no better  proof of that fact than perusing Tumblr. Everywhere you turn (click?)  the  Harry Potter  generation is there pointing out some serious points regarding the fandom.  The  beautiful thing about the Internet is that it gives people a chance to  see the series from another person's eyes. Sometimes it's beautiful and  heartfelt, and others it's just...well, it's something. Check out these 10  more  times that Tumblr users made absolute sense, and opened my eyes to certain truths in the  Harry Potter  series:   1. When they realized that Harry was looking for advice in all the wrong places       C'mon Hedwig, you should know this one! Aren't owls all well-equipped to handle existential crises?   2. When they pointed out who should have been the real star of the show       Ugh Sirius-ly, though. Always such a flair for the dramatic with that guy.   3. When they noticed this uncanny resemblance    Probably one of the biggest, or at least comical, differences between  the books and the movies. Please, someone tell me who let this happen.    4. When they found that even Voldemort lived by a code       5. When they pictured this hilarious scenario    Leave it to Tonks to play a grand-scale prank like that. I always wish  that she, the marauder's, and the Weasley twins were all at Hogwarts  together. Could you imagine? Pure chaos.   6. When they put a stop to Tom Riddle's madness       Way to go, Fat Amy. Please refrain from using that word in the future, Tom.    dada      7. When they discussed who really taught Ginny Weasley about the birds and the bees  See?  He wasn't such a bad guy. That's a tough talk to have! It might as well  come from a mysterious journal if no one else is going to do it.   8. When they saw that you don't have to be human to love Harry Potter      9. When they recognized Voldemort wasn't so bad, again       After  spending so much time on Tumblr, I've started to forget why Voldemort  is such a bad guy. Oh right, all of the senseless killing and Muggle  hating. Yeah, that wasn't great.   10. When they finally saw the disappointing truth about post-Harry Potter Hogwarts       Ads nel Post     I mean, yeah education, but  magical  education! No matter how you slice it it's still better than my high school experience.

Shops: the Handweavers Studio   by   Corrie Berry   Posted on   March 21, 2015    .entry-meta     Lucky enough to live a few hundred metres away from the Handweavers Studio, I have never got round to actually reviewing it. Well, my friends, that has all changed! I went in a few weeks ago and spent a good long time taking photos and enjoying the vibes of the shop. The layout had recently changed, so I was a little bit lost, which made for a better review as I had to pay proper attention to everything.        The Handweavers Studio as you approach (complete with reflection of workmen!)  The Handweavers Studio can be found at 140 Seven Sisters Road, London, N7 7NS. The website is  here !  The Handweavers Studio  The shop is laid out into three sections, so I’ll go through them from front to back for ease of sorting out my photos!  Front of House  Walking into the shop, you are hit by the fact that there is stacks of wool, everywhere. I don’t mean that in a haphazard sort of way – more of a mind-boggling array of ordered merino tops, selections of yarn, and woven samples on a number of looms that are arranged around the floor. Display cabinets contain some of the more luxury items, including Turkish spindles and needle felting equipment that has fossilised  dinosaur  in it (see the photos for information on what this means).        Walking into the shop with a beautiful view towards the back of it.        Merino tops in the very front of the shop.        A couple of looms, the Ashford Knitters Loom is closest to me.        A range of Turkish spindles in the front of the shop.        Needle felting tools – with a fossilised dinosaur bone embedded in the handle of the needle holder.        The front of the shop, welcoming you with a riot of colour.        Some felting supplies to grab and go.        Stacks of glitter fibre near the till.        Yarns and looms in the front of the shop.        More of the welcoming colourful fibre.  The till is also here, always occupied by a lovely person – all of the staff have some interest in the world of weaving, and I’ve never yet had an experience where I’ve asked for advice or help and been unhappy with the response.  Almost the best bit in a shop full of best bits, is the book selection. They have everything you could possibly ask for and more. With a huge range of ‘how-to’ manuals on all the fibre crafts they cater to, as well as reference material and magazines that I honestly had no idea existed until I really looked at them, every time I go in I have a look at the selection and wish I were a millionaire! I have bought more than my fair share of tomes from here, and no doubt there will be more before I leave London.        The Handweavers Studio has got the most amazing selection of books, from general reference to knitting, spinning to felting, and obviously a lot of weaving!        A big range of spinning books.        Knitting Books are not left out!        Books on felting – not that I’m obsessed with felt at the moment…  The Middle Aisles  The centre of the shop is where the yarn is. Catering mostly to weavers, the majority of the yarn is on cones, in a bewildering array of fibres, colours and textures. It is quite hard to appreciate how incredible these yarns are as a (primarily) hand-knitter, as I’m so used to skeins – I will have to go back once my weaving skills have improved and have another look to fully appreciate everything. However, the amount of choice of colour alone is fabulous, and there are also beautifully presented samples on each shelf-end and wall to inspire you as you browse.  This section also has yarns that I would consider more ‘hand-knitters’ yarns, with beautiful hand-painted skeins, pure wool spun in interesting ways, tweedy yarn, fibre blends and ‘plain’ pure wool. There is colour and texture inspiration here in spades.        Can you see how you could get absolutely lost in the yarns?        Yet more wool, and a noticeboard at the end.        Bobbins full of yarn and a beautiful piece of weaving.        More yarns, more weaving.        Beautiful silk yarns.        A selection of pure wool yarns.        A bookcase full of handpainted yarns.        Another beautiful passage lined with yarn.        Close-up of those gorgeous hand-painted yarns.        A lovely noticeboard with local messages.        Notice for the London Guild of Weavers, Spinners and Dyers.        I’m going to contact this person – but for anyone in North Islington, a group for you!  Equipment Shop  The back of the shop is where the majority of the equipment lies. With an army of spinning wheels, big looms and a variety of fibre preparation accessories, I normally head straight here to admire the architecture of my craft. I fairly regularly walk in looking for some random piece of equipment that I need  right now  that I’m sure I won’t find, only to see it nestled on a shelf exactly where I need it.  If by any chance the accessory I need isn’t there, asking for it normally produces results – I enquired on a specific size of niddy-noddy on the off-chance once, and within a couple of minutes it had been brought down from the top of the shop. Magic.  Sacks full of roving are also found here, whether it is different varieties of wool, processed tops or artificial fibres.        An army of spinning wheels – these are used in the lessons.        A hand-turned spinning wheel.        For the aspiring dyer, a huge range of types and colours of dye.        Weaving and spinning accessories, from carders to shuttles to wool winders.        Sacks full of roving of artificial fibres.        Sacks of more artificial or processed fibre roving.        Here are sacks of wool roving for spinners and felting.  Lessons and Workshops  I have done a spinning workshop at the Handweavers Studio, with the talented Brenda Gibson. (Find out more  here .) It took place on the shop floor, and it was great to have the whole shop at our disposal on a Sunday – it was not open to the general public, but we were able to browse as much as we wanted. I understand there is a big weaving classroom upstairs, but I’ve never been up there – I may ask for a tour the next time I go in, especially as I’m now a weaver too! Heehee.  They have a great range of classes and workshops, and you can also do a handweavers diploma through the shop – the full range and schedule is  here .   If you hadn’t worked it out already, this is one of my favourite places. I would love the shop to have a sofa so that I could go in and just hang out…although I don’t think that will be happening anytime soon, just at my request! I have just one comment which I will include for the sake of balance.  First off, the shop is relatively pricey. I understand, as I’m sure most people do, that excellent quality equipment comes at a fair cost; but you can get a lot of the equipment that is sold here cheaper off the Internet. That said, I always prefer to support bricks-and-mortar shops, and I have bought many ‘somethings’ from the Handweavers Studio in the past when I could have ordered them cheaper off Amazon. It’s part of the experience of being able to handle things yourself before you buy them, and also not having to pay post and packaging! The chance to touch my roving and yarn before I buy it is also invaluable to me, really.  I fully recommend you make it your mission to visit the Handweavers Studio if you are a fibre crafter living in London, and have never been. The nearest tube station is Finsbury Park (which is also on the National Rail network…) and bus links are excellent.  If you do head over, let me know! It’s a ten minute walk for me to come meet you, and there are some fab places to grab a cuppa on Seven Sisters Road.  Happy Saturday!  Much love,  Corrie xx        The front of the shop from the middle of the centre aisles.      « Previous  Podcaster, weaver, knitter           .entry-content   This entry was posted in  Knitting ,  Reviews ,  Spinning ,  Weaving  and tagged  Ashford Knitter's Loom ,  books ,  Felting ,  Handweavers Studio ,  Lessons ,  Local Yarn Shop ,  Looms ,  Review ,  Shop Review ,  Spinning ,  spinning wheel ,  The Handweaver's Studio ,  Tops ,  Weaving ,  Wool ,  Workshops ,  Yarn Shop .

Weaving and spinning accessories, from carders to shuttles to wool winders.        Sacks full of roving of artificial fibres.        Sacks of more artificial or processed fibre roving.        Here are sacks of wool roving for spinners and felting.  Lessons and Workshops  I have done a spinning workshop at the Handweavers Studio, with the talented Brenda Gibson. (Find out more  here .) It took place on the shop floor, and it was great to have the whole shop at our disposal on a Sunday – it was not open to the general public, but we were able to browse as much as we wanted. I understand there is a big weaving classroom upstairs, but I’ve never been up there – I may ask for a tour the next time I go in, especially as I’m now a weaver too! Heehee.  They have a great range of classes and workshops, and you can also do a handweavers diploma through the shop – the full range and schedule is  here .   If you hadn’t worked it out already, this is one of my favourite places. I would love the shop to have a sofa so that I could go in and just hang out…although I don’t think that will be happening anytime soon, just at my request! I have just one comment which I will include for the sake of balance.  First off, the shop is relatively pricey. I understand, as I’m sure most people do, that excellent quality equipment comes at a fair cost; but you can get a lot of the equipment that is sold here cheaper off the Internet. That said, I always prefer to support bricks-and-mortar shops, and I have bought many ‘somethings’ from the Handweavers Studio in the past when I could have ordered them cheaper off Amazon. It’s part of the experience of being able to handle things yourself before you buy them, and also not having to pay post and packaging! The chance to touch my roving and yarn before I buy it is also invaluable to me, really.  I fully recommend you make it your mission to visit the Handweavers Studio if you are a fibre crafter living in London, and have never been. The nearest tube station is Finsbury Park (which is also on the National Rail network…) and bus links are excellent.  If you do head over, let me know! It’s a ten minute walk for me to come meet you, and there are some fab places to grab a cuppa on Seven Sisters Road.  Happy Saturday!  Much love,  Corrie xx        The front of the shop from the middle of the centre aisles.      « Previous  Podcaster, weaver, knitter           .entry-content   This entry was posted in  Knitting ,  Reviews ,  Spinning ,  Weaving  and tagged  Ashford Knitter's Loom ,  books ,  Felting ,  Handweavers Studio ,  Lessons ,  Local Yarn Shop ,  Looms ,  Review ,  Shop Review ,  Spinning ,  spinning wheel ,  The Handweaver's Studio ,  Tops ,  Weaving ,  Wool ,  Workshops ,  Yarn Shop .

Shops: the Handweavers Studio   by   Corrie Berry   Posted on   March 21, 2015    .entry-meta     Lucky enough to live a few hundred metres away from the Handweavers Studio, I have never got round to actually reviewing it. Well, my friends, that has all changed! I went in a few weeks ago and spent a good long time taking photos and enjoying the vibes of the shop. The layout had recently changed, so I was a little bit lost, which made for a better review as I had to pay proper attention to everything.        The Handweavers Studio as you approach (complete with reflection of workmen!)  The Handweavers Studio can be found at 140 Seven Sisters Road, London, N7 7NS. The website is  here !  The Handweavers Studio  The shop is laid out into three sections, so I’ll go through them from front to back for ease of sorting out my photos!  Front of House  Walking into the shop, you are hit by the fact that there is stacks of wool, everywhere. I don’t mean that in a haphazard sort of way – more of a mind-boggling array of ordered merino tops, selections of yarn, and woven samples on a number of looms that are arranged around the floor. Display cabinets contain some of the more luxury items, including Turkish spindles and needle felting equipment that has fossilised  dinosaur  in it (see the photos for information on what this means).        Walking into the shop with a beautiful view towards the back of it.        Merino tops in the very front of the shop.        A couple of looms, the Ashford Knitters Loom is closest to me.        A range of Turkish spindles in the front of the shop.        Needle felting tools – with a fossilised dinosaur bone embedded in the handle of the needle holder.        The front of the shop, welcoming you with a riot of colour.        Some felting supplies to grab and go.        Stacks of glitter fibre near the till.        Yarns and looms in the front of the shop.        More of the welcoming colourful fibre.  The till is also here, always occupied by a lovely person – all of the staff have some interest in the world of weaving, and I’ve never yet had an experience where I’ve asked for advice or help and been unhappy with the response.  Almost the best bit in a shop full of best bits, is the book selection. They have everything you could possibly ask for and more. With a huge range of ‘how-to’ manuals on all the fibre crafts they cater to, as well as reference material and magazines that I honestly had no idea existed until I really looked at them, every time I go in I have a look at the selection and wish I were a millionaire! I have bought more than my fair share of tomes from here, and no doubt there will be more before I leave London.        The Handweavers Studio has got the most amazing selection of books, from general reference to knitting, spinning to felting, and obviously a lot of weaving!        A big range of spinning books.        Knitting Books are not left out!        Books on felting – not that I’m obsessed with felt at the moment…  The Middle Aisles  The centre of the shop is where the yarn is. Catering mostly to weavers, the majority of the yarn is on cones, in a bewildering array of fibres, colours and textures. It is quite hard to appreciate how incredible these yarns are as a (primarily) hand-knitter, as I’m so used to skeins – I will have to go back once my weaving skills have improved and have another look to fully appreciate everything. However, the amount of choice of colour alone is fabulous, and there are also beautifully presented samples on each shelf-end and wall to inspire you as you browse.  This section also has yarns that I would consider more ‘hand-knitters’ yarns, with beautiful hand-painted skeins, pure wool spun in interesting ways, tweedy yarn, fibre blends and ‘plain’ pure wool. There is colour and texture inspiration here in spades.        Can you see how you could get absolutely lost in the yarns?        Yet more wool, and a noticeboard at the end.        Bobbins full of yarn and a beautiful piece of weaving.        More yarns, more weaving.        Beautiful silk yarns.        A selection of pure wool yarns.        A bookcase full of handpainted yarns.        Another beautiful passage lined with yarn.        Close-up of those gorgeous hand-painted yarns.        A lovely noticeboard with local messages.        Notice for the London Guild of Weavers, Spinners and Dyers.        I’m going to contact this person – but for anyone in North Islington, a group for you!  Equipment Shop  The back of the shop is where the majority of the equipment lies. With an army of spinning wheels, big looms and a variety of fibre preparation accessories, I normally head straight here to admire the architecture of my craft. I fairly regularly walk in looking for some random piece of equipment that I need  right now  that I’m sure I won’t find, only to see it nestled on a shelf exactly where I need it.  If by any chance the accessory I need isn’t there, asking for it normally produces results – I enquired on a specific size of niddy-noddy on the off-chance once, and within a couple of minutes it had been brought down from the top of the shop. Magic.  Sacks full of roving are also found here, whether it is different varieties of wool, processed tops or artificial fibres.        An army of spinning wheels – these are used in the lessons.        A hand-turned spinning wheel.        For the aspiring dyer, a huge range of types and colours of dye.        Weaving and spinning accessories, from carders to shuttles to wool winders.        Sacks full of roving of artificial fibres.        Sacks of more artificial or processed fibre roving.        Here are sacks of wool roving for spinners and felting.  Lessons and Workshops  I have done a spinning workshop at the Handweavers Studio, with the talented Brenda Gibson. (Find out more  here .) It took place on the shop floor, and it was great to have the whole shop at our disposal on a Sunday – it was not open to the general public, but we were able to browse as much as we wanted. I understand there is a big weaving classroom upstairs, but I’ve never been up there – I may ask for a tour the next time I go in, especially as I’m now a weaver too! Heehee.  They have a great range of classes and workshops, and you can also do a handweavers diploma through the shop – the full range and schedule is  here .

I fully recommend you make it your mission to visit the Handweavers Studio if you are a fibre crafter living in London, and have never been. The nearest tube station is Finsbury Park (which is also on the National Rail network…) and bus links are excellent.  If you do head over, let me know! It’s a ten minute walk for me to come meet you, and there are some fab places to grab a cuppa on Seven Sisters Road.  Happy Saturday!  Much love,  Corrie xx        The front of the shop from the middle of the centre aisles.      « Previous  Podcaster, weaver, knitter           .entry-content     Posted in   Knitting ,  Reviews ,  Spinning ,  Weaving    |   Tagged   Ashford Knitter's Loom ,  books ,  Felting ,  Handweavers Studio ,  Lessons ,  Local Yarn Shop ,  Looms ,  Review ,  Shop Review ,  Spinning ,  spinning wheel ,  The Handweaver's Studio ,  Tops ,  Weaving ,  Wool ,  Workshops ,  Yarn Shop    |  Leave a comment   .entry-utility    #post-##     Podcaster, weaver, knitter   by   Corrie Berry   Posted on   March 20, 2015    .entry-meta     I had a big badge at Edinburgh Yarn Festival which proclaimed that I am a podcaster. And I am! Isn’t that strange? Who knew this time last year that I would own things like microphones and audio editing software.  I’ve been feeling reflective for the last few days, as I’ve had a sinus infection which I caught off John just before going to Edinburgh, and I’ve spent a fair amount of time in bed, trying to catch up on reading blogs and watching podcasts. I’ll try not let the reflection get too deep…today. Additionally – it’s International Day of Happiness today! In addition to the normal parties, I’m linking with  Happy Friday  over at Planet Penny today.  I am a Podcaster  As I say, I had a big badge saying I was a podcaster last weekend. Oh my goodness, Edinburgh Yarn Festival was amazing. Really wonderful. The best bit was the people. I got to meet so many of my Twitter friends who I have ‘known’ for years, but never spoken to face-to-face. I met the podcasters, who I feel like I know and who I spend a lot of every day with as I work my way through their shows. I met people I’ve emailed about things, my ‘exhibition family’ in the form of vendors such as  Purl Alpaca  and  Belinda Harris-Reid , people who I see at every show. I spent two days with  my  people. It was glorious!  I also realised that I  am  a podcaster. You can listen  here !        The wonderful friends I made at Edinburgh Yarn Festival (photo from the pop-up studio)        A tiny selection of the podcasters I got to spend my time with.  I will record a new podcast episode when I sound less like a muppet, and all the low-down will go into that. I’m still on a high, though, and can’t wait for the next event*.  I am a Weaver  While at the Edinburgh Yarn Festival, I bought a loom. I have been thinking about making this purchase ever since Martine over at  iMake  got an Ashford Knitter’s Loom…and I was so excited about it that I proceeded to tell  everyone  that I met about it. I also told the people I had already told about it that I had bought it. Every five minutes. Sorry about that!  I ‘cast on’ a project as soon as I got back to London (please let me know what the technical term for that is?) and finished a scarf on Tuesday. It’s far too short and the tension is so funny – but I’m sure this will be another project which I frame and add to my display of “first spun yarn”, “first machine knitting” and so on.        My first ever woven scarf.  You’ll hear a lot more about weaving in the future!  I am a Knitter  There are multiple parts to this identity this week! I got so much knitting done while in Edinburgh – I finished the Angel Socks, which are currently blocked and drying and therefore un-photographed.        Working on my Angel socks with a matching teapot in Edinburgh!  I also (finally) cast on Naloa by  Renee Callahan , and am a good way through the first chart. I’ve had the yarn for this for months, the pattern for slightly less amount of time, and I’ve been promising myself I will cast on for as long as the pattern has been out. It feels wonderful to have started a brand new project that has been weighing on my mind – and I’m loving how it is turning out!  On the subject of Renee, I went to a lesson with her at  Wild and Wooly  on Wednesday night. I met some old friends there, as well as a couple of new people. We started working on Saguaro, a beautiful pattern of Renee’s, which involves two-colour cables in absolutely divine Malabrigo Rios yarn. I had a skein of “Indiecita” in my stash, and bought another of “Sunset” from Anna at WandW – the two colours are knitting up beautifully, and I am loving the new technique.        Working on my cowl during our lesson at Wild and Wooly (photo copyright Renee Callahan 2015)        A half-done cowl with Renee’s beautiful Saguaro pattern.  That’s my five things for today! They are all making me feel incredibly happy, positive, and blessed to be part of this little fibre-y community, and the misery of my sinuses have been overshadowed by the joy I’ve felt while working my way through the network I am fortunate enough to belong to.  So, have a wonderful weekend, and hopefully by next post I will be back to my normal non-reflective, brash and silly self!!  Much love,  Corrie xx   Just a quick note, sometimes at the bottom of a post you’ll see a badge linking to things like “Five on Friday”, “Wool on Sunday” and so on. These are link parties, and clicking on them will take you to other bloggers who are concentrating on that rough theme too, so that if you find you want to catch up with the world, you have a good starting point.  * The next event I will be at will be  p-Lush  in Coventry on Friday and Saturday next week. I hope to see you there!          « Previous  The Spring K&S; Show 2015: Part Four       Next »  Local Yarn(?)

You’re either breathing a sigh of relief, or unhappy about it! Never fear, there are more shows for me to review, Edinburgh Yarn Festival just the first of them.  The full story of the Knitting and Stitching Show is spread over parts  one ,  two ,  three  and  four .  The Spring Knitting and Stitching Show: Part Four  These are the final few vendors that I visited at the show. No more introduction…straight into it!  Black Bat  As a fan of wool, and especially British at that, I was excited to find out more about this company, which I had not heard about before. The company is truly inspiring; they buy fleeces off small-holders who would not otherwise be able to get their wool spun. They concentrate particularly on rare breeds, and spin the wool in limited runs.  With a huge range of different types of wool, beautiful patterns and samples of various yarns knit up, it was wonderful to see the stand. None of the yarn was dyed, which was a wonderfully refreshing sight in amidst the riot of colour that most of the other stands had.  Find out more about the company  here .        The corner of the Black Bat stall, with a wonderful range of yarns.        Samples of the yarn knitted up into beautiful scarves.        Fleece for spinning from a number of different British breeds.        More yarns, with samples below.  Cashmered  Can you say luxury? I spent a good, long time admiring the yarn of Cashmered. This is all 100% cashmere, with a range of twenty different colours, patterns and kits available to the fibre artist who wishes to indulge themself. With a well laid-out stand and a beautiful photo of goats to lure passers-by in, I kept getting drawn back to the stand as I came past it. I have added this yarn to my wish-list.  Find out more  here .        The range of Cashmered yarns.        Cashmered samples – isn’t the crocodile stitch shawl on the left stunning?        More Cashmered samples enticed me in.        Cashmere child clothes? Your tot would be so comfy!        Who doesn’t love a good picture of goats?Cas  Debonnaire  If you have ever listened to my podcast, you will know how much I adore sparkly yarn. Well, Debonnaire had it in bucketfuls. I absolutely adored walking past the stand, touching the yarn softly, and getting lost in the shimmering colours. The dyer is Erica, and she has an incredible amount of yarn available. The knitted samples looked so beautiful! I loved the colour and was very excited about the beauty and quality of the yarn.  Find out more about Debonnaire  here .        The full range of beautiful Debonnaire yarn.        Sequin yarns, a kaleidescope of colour.        The yarn, slightly more close-up.  Jennie Atkinson  I bought a lot of Kidsilk Haze in Hobbycraft once, and half of it is designated to a Jennie Atkinson design. These are vintage inspired patterns which have a delicacy that is really compelling. I first saw them at Unravel a few years ago, and ever since have admired the design that I will one day knit. It’s for a night-dress, and if you would like to find out more, you can do so  here .  Jennie was also selling her book, “A Handknit Romance”, which is just beautiful, and has a lot of projects on Ravelry.        The Jennie Atkinson dress that I will one day knit.        More of Jennie’s designs.    The Knitting Hut  I was lucky enough to do a giveaway of one of Sue Stratford’s book last year, and was excited to see her stand once again. She had a large number of knitted samples arranged around the stand, as well as a full range of books and kits. It was wonderful to see them all around, and makes me want to get my Knitted Cats and Kittens book out once again! Find out more  here .        The Knitting Hut cats and kittens.        Knitting kits in a box, with all of our most loved characters from the books.    Namolio  This was yet  another  new-to-me yarn company, and the range of gradient yarns they stocked had me stop in wonder as I tried to walk past the first time. I have never seen such beautiful balls of yarn, and I knew that I must have one of these one day (more on that another time). The company concentrates on linen and wool, as well as accessories – she had some hilarious greetings cards for knitters on the wall which were fantastic. The full range is  here .        Namolio gradient yarns.        Beautiful cards on the wall of the stand.  Rachel John  I’ve been excited by gigantic knitting in the past, and with a beam of sunlight highlighting some of Rachel’s samples, this stand was no less entrancing. I was with Kelly, a friend from the Great London Yarn Crawl, at this point, and she decided to buy a giant crochet hook to try out. It was fun looking at a number of different shapes and objects on this stand, which was almost an Aladdin’s cave. Find out more  here .        http://www.serenaanncollections.bigcartel.com/        I enjoyed this fella – no idea what it’s meant to be, but looks like a delightful face.        Samples lining the top of Rachel’s stall.        Stacks of gorgeous yarn to transform into architecture of knitting.        A wire cat! Of course.  Serena Ann Designs  This company was not on my list of people to go visit, until I got a message from someone on Twitter asking me to go. The website is here: it’s a start-up company run by Alex, who sources beautiful bags from Thailand. These bags are a wonder to behold. They are changeable, from a shoulder-bag to a back-pack, as well as big to little. A bag was my one big purchase of the weekend – in a beautiful paint splatter pattern. I will take a photo of it for you another time; for now enjoy this one of a beaming Alex, who you can find out about  here .        Alex with some of his Serena Ann Collections bags.  Tall Yarns  With a collection of clothes and yarns, I enjoyed looking at the skirts that the Tall Yarns ladies were selling. I love the style of the clothes, the text the company name is written in sings to me, and can I say I love colour again? Not only is the pattern support for the yarns absolutely incredible, but Jennie Atkinson from earlier in this post (!) has written some of her designs in their yarn. I’m in love with this company. Find the full range  here , and do not blame me if I have enabled you.        The Tall Yarns banner! Love this.        Yarns and clothes, jewel bright and wonderful.        Shawls and Scarves and Tops and Skirts….I think there’s a song in there somewhere.        Those greens are beautiful!  Watercolours and Lace  This is the last one! And the description of the company matches the yarn absolutely brilliantly. The skeins are handpainted, in beautiful soft colours that blend together gently and complement the feeing of the yarns. The weight of the yarn does not go above 4-ply, so for delicate patterns and something a bit different, this is where you must go. Find out more  here .        Watercolours and Lace yarn knitted up into samples.        Cages full of hand-painted yarns.        You can get a better idea of the colour variations here.        More yarns, with accompanying pattern support.   That’s it for the Spring Knitting and Stitching Show 2015! I hope you enjoyed the recounting of it – I’m going to breath a sigh of relief for a bit, and go do some weaving. I will delay the giveaway that I promised for today to next week – so make sure you head over on Monday to find out what you can enter for.

I’ve already talked about the various exhibitions that I enjoyed, hanging out on the Sincerely Louise stall, as well as some of the vendors. Now for the next instalment!  The full story of the Knitting and Stitching Show is spread over parts  one , two ,  three  and  four .  The Spring Knitting and Stitching Show 2015  More vendors galore today! Grab a cup of tea, it’s a long one for your pleasure. Enjoy yourself and feel free to contact me either using the Plutonium Muffins  form , or via email using my address, corrie[at]plutoniummuffins.com.  Knitting Aid  I was very keen to check out the knitting aid, and give it a go too. A new invention by David Hill, this is a gadget that is designed to help knitters with arthritis, by taking the weight of one’s knitting and allowing the main work to be done by the gadget. You can find out more about it  here . I did give it a go, but I wasn’t too sure about it. I suspect it would take a bit of getting used to, and I would have to learn to hold my needles in a different way to the present position.  The story behind the aid is what makes me so eager to watch what happens with it, and I am looking forward to seeing David in the future.        David Hill demonstrating use of the Knitting Aid.  Mrs Moon  This is a yarn company based in Twickenham – it used to have a bricks and mortar store, but has since become online only. At this show, they launched a new range of yarns – Plump. The yarn was wonderful and soft, and they had an incredible blanket sample knitted up which made me want to forget about budget and splurge!  I somehow missed taking a photograph of the fabulous blanket, but you can find Mrs Moon’s patterns  here . I didn’t make note of what it was called either. I will send them an email and chastise myself later.        Mrs Moon patterns and samples.        Mrs Moon’s new range of yarn, Plump.        More of the Plump, in interesting colours. Very tempting!  Natali Stewart  A new-to-me yarn and fibre company, Natali Stewart excelled in the area of silk. With a huge selection of colours and blends, roving, dyed but otherwise unprocessed locks, skeins of yarn, bricks of silk…this was a luxury fibre dream. Again, I could have bought so many things from Natali, who was lovely – you can find out more  here .  I was very eager to have a root around through a big pile of dyed Wensleydale locks (I believe), but I resisted as I knew I would not be able to resist. However, if you are a spinner and you come upon Natali’s stand at a show, have a look. You won’t regret it.        The Natali Stewart Stand with a glorious selection of yarns on the wall.        Stack of yarns and roving and felt and fabric…heaven.        A huge pile of the most delicious fibres.        Silk Bricks on the Natali Stewart stand.  Redhound for Dogs  Next up was Redhound for Dogs, a company which designs kits, patterns and accessories for dogs. They are at every show I go to, just about, and their kits are a delight. I asked if they did one for a cocker spaniel sized dog and was told that those types of dogs don’t need clothes…I beg to differ, but fair enough!  The range they design for is for small, slim-type dogs such as whippets, jack-russels and so forth. Find out more  here . If I ever decide I need to make knitwear for a dog, this is probably where I will go to find it.        The Redhound for Dogs stall with a range of kits for punters.  Sheep on Mars  There was one reason I headed for the Sheep on Mars stand – the name! Everyone knows that Plutonium Muffins is based on the idea of a muffin shop on Pluto (what do you mean you didn’t know that?!) and I wanted to say hi to my intergalactic neighbours. The added bonus was that the stand was lovely!  Natasha is a dyer with some gorgeous yarns, fibres and products to admire – I am so pleased I made a point of going over to meet her. Find her Etsy shop  here . She has not been going for very long, and has a very supportive partner who is helping her get going. I can’t wait to get some fibre from her.        Sheep on Mars with Natasha beaming at me.  The Little Knitting Company  This vendor was also, somehow, new to me. The stand was located just opposite Louise, and I spent much of the weekend admiring the displays of Soak, the wool-friendly detergent. Once I decided to go and check them out, I was delighted by the range of fuzzy yarns, stitch markers and knitting kits available. Of particular interest were the juggling ball kits!  The prices were also reasonable, in my opinion, and this is where I nearly fell down on my resolution not to buy any extra yarn. You can fall down too – go  here .        The Little Knitting Company with a corner of Soak.        Some gorgeous yarns, what a halo these would produce.        Juggling kits! I’m loving the penguins, this is what I nearly bought.        Cashmere skeins in royal colours, for a good price. I nearly did it!  Art Felt  With my new fascination for felt, I spent some time chatting to Andrea over at Art Felt, a company which produces kits for creating products using a combination of wet and dry felting. I loved this idea! Even better, Andrea is passionate about sharing ideas and knowledge, and I am excited to see how my relationship with her develops! You can find her kits  here  – be sure to check out the hedgehogs.        The Art Felt Stand, the proprietor was passionate about community and sharing of knowledge, which resonates with me.        The Art Felt stand, with flowers on the wall as a bonus.      That’s all for now! Check back tomorrow for the final instalment on the Spring Knitting and Stitching Show 2015, and on Thursday for a  fabulous  giveaway from one of my favourite fibre companies.

The full story of the Knitting and Stitching Show is spread over parts  one , two ,  three  and  four .  The Spring Knitting and Stitching Show: Part Two  Whilst spending some time on the Sincerely Louise stand, helping out Louise and generally chatting to people who found her faux taxidermy highly amusing and inspiring, I also got to go around and check out the rest of the show. There were lots of lovely vendors, some old friends and some new ones made. I was very restrained and only bought one ball of green acrylic yarn, for a quick project I promised a friend a long time ago – so no stash to talk of, but lots of interesting people to share with you.  I have already told you about Toft, Belinda Harris-Reid and Purl Alpaca, so head over to Part One to find out what they were up to.  Ann’s Orchard Beadwork  This was the neighbouring stand to Sincerely Louis, run by the fascinating Emma. With kits and supplies to make up bead pictures and works of art, I spent some time cooing over her designs. My favourite design was definitely Bob the Penguin – closely followed by Bert the Mole. You can check them all out  here .        Ann’s Orchard Beadwork, Louise’s lovely next-door neighbour.  Emma used to study the science behind potatoes, and was really interesting to talk to. Not only that, the company was so called because the land the home of Emma and her family is built on was given as part of Anne Boleyn’s dowry on the occasion of her wedding to King Henry the Eighth! I loved talking to her, and can’t wait to see what she comes up with next.  Black Sheep Wools  I did not take a lot of photos when I visited Black Sheep, but I enjoyed looking at their display for the first time this year. The bulk of their stand is generally made up of lots of yarn in a big pile – fun if you’re looking for a bargain, but I was trying not to tempt myself. I loved the colourful blankets they had pinned up around the place, and also some mugs they were selling.        The Black Sheep stand is always huge, with lots to look at.        I also loved these fluffy softies. They’re a nightmare to knit up, but you can’t beat a fluffy teddy bear!        Black Sheep Wools mugs – I wanted the one of the sheep knitting himself up, it was cute!        The Black Sheep Wool stand with a beautiful crochet blanket for our pleasure.  Black Sheep are a stalwart of big exhibitions, so if you go to a ‘large’ show, you’re bound to find them there. Otherwise, they’re also online  here .  Little Gem Knits  Next up was Little Gem Knits, an exhibitor who I was really interested in because of their felting kits. I don’t know how well you can see in the photo, but they have some fabulous landscapes with the most incredible combinations of colour! There were also a number of African scenes, which always draws my eye. The guardian of the stall was needle-felting some giraffes, which tickled me.        Little Gem Knits, with a plethora of beautiful kits, as well as finished objects for sale.        I adored this sheepy scene! Aren’t the colours beautifully blended?  Don’t be confused by the name – they deal more with felt than with knitting. Find out more  here .  international feltmakers association  Sticking with the theme of felt (can you tell I was inspired by my purchase of Jenny Barnett’s book?), I also visited the IFA to find out more about this side of the world of wool. I was just in time for a demonstration on how to make a gorgeous felted flower – something I am certainly going to have to try myself!  The chat with the ladies was inspiring, one from New Zealand who immigrated to the UK a very long time ago and got involved with the IFA as a way to stay with a community, and the other a felt-maker who has literally covered her house from top-to-bottom in glorious wool creations.        The IFA display – isn’t that coat incredible?        Another beautiful felted coat.        Time for a demonstration from one of the IFA volunteers!        Samples on the wall, showing the progression from a loosely felted leaf on green background, to the finished article.  You can find out more and join the association  here .   Although I’ve written up a lot of the other vendors, I’ve lost my steam a little for now and I’m going to head off and finish a scarf I’m knitting for a commission! (And get a cuppa, that’s important.) See you tomorrow!

I took over 300 photos, but even edited down and cut to the best, there are far too many to share in just one post, so there will be a few posts spread out over this week.  The full story of the Knitting and Stitching Show is spread over parts  one ,  two ,  three  and  four .        Entering the Spring Knitting and Stitching Show from the side-entrance (smaller queues, FYI!)  I know some of you are keen to hear about Edinburgh Yarn Festival! I’ll do a podcast later this week once I’ve got home (I’m still in Edinburgh) and make sure all the craic is recorded for future reference.  The Spring Knitting and Stitching Show  After meeting the lovely Louise at  Unravel , I offered her a bit of help on her stand for this show, which found me with an exhibitors pass at the  Sincerely Louise  stand on Friday and Saturday. It was really nice to spend some time with a designer who came to knitting in a totally different way to me. I enjoyed getting to know Louise better, as well as meeting all of the people who were enthusiastic about her book!  Louise had the book, “Faux Taxidermy Knits”, as well as all the samples to show people during the show. She also had her taxidermy heads on the walls of her stand, which stopped at least half of the people who walked past the stand. It was wonderful to be part of that, and to bask in some of Louise’s glory…having done none of the hard work!        Sincerely Louise at the Spring Knitting and Stitching Show, chatting to customers.        Louise and her wonderful frog t-shirt, which recently featured in Vogue!        A quick turn-around of the stand to mix things up on Saturday.    On Friday, I did a bit of exploring of the rest of the exhibition; particularly the individual exhibitions that had been prepared for show during the course of the weekend. Those which I took particular interest in were “The National Fashion Textiles Competition”, “The Knitted Farm” and “The Crochet Jungle”.  It was hard to miss the National Fashion Textiles Competition, as it was right in the passageway between the two main sections of the hall which the exhibition was split over. Even so, it caught my eye for sure – particularly the winning entry, which I believe my cousin would look stunning in. I wish I had the skills to translate my half-crazed mind’s eye into clothing! The exhibition was certainly inspiring.        The National Fashion Textiles Competition entries.        The winning dress, which would suit Roxy down to the ground.        The winning dress again, with another stunning design behind it.        Wrist cuffs in the fashion show.  The Knitted Farm  was obviously of interest because it was the main knitting exhibit at the show. Conceived by Sally Muir and Joanna Osbourne, the authors of “Knit Your Own Farm”, a knitted farm was arranged on a pedestal, with some of the cutest knitted farm creatures I have ever seen. All of the critters were knitted as part of a competition, and the winners were highly deserving: this turkey knitted by Deborah Ireland came first, followed by Anne Zoyroydi’s beautiful piggys, and in third place was a knitted horse with attitude by Gillian Earle.        The knitted farm in all of it’s glory.        A little field scene, complete with a proud rooster.        Geese are some of my favourite birds, this pond is adorable.        Adorable yarn-producing animals! Loving the billy goat.        More chickens, with an imposter in their midst!        The Knitted Farm winner, a majestic turkey.        A sow and her piglets, second place in the Knitted Farm competition.        This handsome fella came third. I adore the tufts at his hooves!    I lost myself in these for a little while, and nearly bought the book…but with hundreds of books in my shelves, I decided not to add another one before I’ve read some of the others…  The Crochet Jungle  is a project by one of the designers over at  TOFT Alpaca  – Kerry Lord – and aims to inspire children and adults to take up crochet by igniting their imaginations. It looked like a magical wonderland, with crocheted vines everywhere, and a giant crocheted monkey presiding over things. It was fabulous! I also wanted the Edward’s Menagerie book, but see the above comment – and the fact that I can’t crochet (yet)!        The Crochet Jungle, complete with giant monkey.               A string of monkeys from Edward’s Menagerie, a beautiful book with over 40 patterns for crochet beasties.    For the rest of the day, apart from spending time helping Louise out, I met up with Kelly, one of the volunteers from last year’s  Great London Yarn Crawl , and had a natter with her. I also spent some time with the ladies at  Purl Alpaca Designs , who have almost become family after the amount of time I’ve spent with them this year! Kari-Helene is the designer of the amazing  Icon Dress , which I wore on Friday to show off to her.        The beautiful Purl Alpaca ladies, with the Icon Dress that inspired me behind them.  Popping along to say hi to  Belinda Harris-Reid , I got her to pose next to the fabulous Strawberry Pi Shawl, which she designed and takes to every show. Just a stunning sampler shawl, this is one for which I have all of the yarn and needles, but not the courage to start yet. You’ll see it as a finished object around these parts one of these days.        Belinda Harris-Reid with her absolutely stunning design, the Strawberry Pi Shawl.        A collection of wonderful alpaca designs.        Shawl pins to buy from Belinda.        One of Belinda’s other fabulous designs, for the patriot!  Excitingly, on Saturday all of the contestants from “The Great British Sewing Bee” were wandering around the show. I wanted to go say ‘hello’, until I remembered that they are essentially also just normal people! So I left it. But I did go and say hello to Mr X Stitch, who I have really respected for a very long time.        Mr X Stitch and some of his wonderful designs.  I saw a lot more people, and will talk about specific vendors when I post my photos of them over the next couple of days (if they ever upload…) I really hope you’ve had a bit of a taste of the show anyway, and enjoyed it even if you couldn’t go. I thought the quality of the knitting vendors at the show this year was a marked step up from previous years, and I’m looking forward to seeing how the show grows.

I’ve sneakily included a finished object here…read to the end to find out what it is! It has been such a busy week. I have pages of lists of blog posts I want to write, hundreds of photos to process, and I’m currently on my way to Edinburgh for the yarn festival. It has been wonderful!  Tonks the Cat  This week, Tonks went on heat. Again. Since we got her, she’s gone on heat about every two weeks. No joke. The first time it happened, I thought she was really sick, she was so needy and she stopped using her litter tray properly…I called up and asked the vet for advice and they said they thought she was in heat. They also told me unless we waited for at least two weeks after her last heat, there would be a surcharge for the surgery because it was more risky.  Well. After three months of fortnightly heats, I gave up on the idea that we would be able to wait for two weeks, and just got her booked in for her appointment this morning. It was absolutely horrific leaving my darling kitty at the vets – I felt like the biggest traitor on Earth. When she got back she was very wobbly and unsure about herself – but it didn’t stop her trying to kill my stitch-markers, and I’m sure she will be right as rain before very long at all.        John and Tonks messing about while Tonks was chilled out.        Tonks is not very happy after her spay.  The Muse Connection  I wrote a long post about the Muse Connection, which you can read here. I really enjoyed the event, and I can’t wait to go to the second! I finally got round to photographing my yarn swap stash – I was highly successful (greedy?) and my “cold sheep” was a distant memory.  It counts as souvenir yarn!!        Stash from the Muse Connection Volume One  Knitting Machine Weights  I got a new knitting machine a few weeks ago – a Brother KH-710. I will give a good review of that when I’ve got fewer blog posts to write about events, but I received new weights for it in the post yesterday and immediately jumped to trying out some hand-knitting I had been commissioned to do on the machine instead. (I wasn’t highly successful, and ended up hand-knitting it anyway…but it was nice to play!)  You’ll see a lot more about this before long, I’m very excited about it.        New weight for my knitting machine.  Operation Sock Drawer  If you don’t know anything about operation sock drawer, head over the Knitmore Girls to find out more! I have been trying to make myself loads of socks to fill up my drawer. This is not going so well at the moment – this is the sum total of hand-knit socks that I have, and one of these pairs belongs to John…  It has motivated me to get knitting! Although as I type this, I’m sitting on a train to Edinburgh, and I was supposed to be sock knitting on the journey…but I left the pattern in the flat. Oops.        The start of a sock drawer of knitted socks!  Finished Object – Craft Hat  I posted a  teaser  to this project the other day. Lots of people guessed correctly – the mystery object was a pom-pom. It wasn’t particularly subtle, was it? Melanie won the prize for the most original guess, as she thought it may have been a pygmy puff. Brilliant.  The hat is knit from Berroco Ultra Alpaca in the brightest, mustardiest yellow I could find. It matches Craft Boss Lizzie’s Weasley Sweater, and knitted up really quickly on 4.5 mm needles. I was walking around the Knitting and Stitching Show last weekend carrying it – so if you saw me with bits of yellow trailing behind me, that’s what it was!        Craft Boss wearing her very own Weasley Sweater!        Lizzie with her new hat, beaming!        The hat from the side, with requisite gigantic pom-pom.  There are so many blog posts in the pipeline, so if there is anything in particular that you want to hear about, let me know – otherwise I will just work my way through them.

This was the inaugural event for  The Muse Connection , a collaboration between Kate of  A Playful Day , and Helen Stewart of  Curious Handmade . For more information, check out their websites.  Before you head on to find out what we got up to, please note that tickets for the Muse Connection: Volume Two will be going up on sale soon. Keep an eye out for them – they will go quickly. You can sign up for notifications  here .  The Muse Connection: Volume One  Drink, Shop & Do is a crafty cafe in Kings Cross, on Caledonian Road. To find out more about the venue and its programme of events, check out the website  HERE . Suffice to say, it’s an arty place with cake, tea and a beautiful building – perfect for a collection of yarn lovers.  I live very close to the venue – it started at 2:30 and went on till 5:30. I hung around outside because I was super early (I was on the phone to my gran in case you’re wondering what I did) and when I entered at 2:20, the place was already packed. We were in a room right at the back, through the cafe, which had a  huge  disco ball hanging in it – brilliant for the party!        The outside of Drink, Shop & Do.  I sat on a table with the wonderful Irene, as well as two other ladies whose names I unfortunately do not remember! Disaster. One of them had a very cute little baby boy who was nine months old and adorable. He was very, very good and a pleasure to make silly faces at, haha.  After a while of simply sitting, knitting and drinking tasty tea, cake arrived! What could be better? Helen then gave a lovely talk on the theory of colour. It was fantastic – I recorded it on my phone, and unfortunately the sound quality was terrible. From my notes, I can tell you the most interesting fact I learned – in order to help you decide whether not certain colours go together in terms of their greyscale tone (or “value”), you can take a photo of the yarn together on your iPhone to check the contrast. This should be done on the  monofilter . Handy tip!  When Helen had finished talking and showing us her samples (she held one up as an example of terrible colour-matching, but I would have matched the same colours and I don’t think they were bad…clearly it’s subjective!) we continued chatting.        Helen Stewart giving a talk on colour theory at the Muse Connection Volume One.  I may be wrong about when the cake arrived – it may have been at this point. I’m mentioning it again, because cake!!  We then had a yarn swap. Kate wrote a fantastic blog on hosting one of these – check it out  here . I came home with a wonderful array of yarns, which I will do a separate blog post on later. Suffice to say, it was incredibly exciting and made me almost giddy. This was the only moment of the day I suffered any anxiety…which is a testament to the great atmosphere of the event, and the buttons that new yarn pushes when I see it!  Following the yarn swap, a lot more chatter and some more tea, Kate gave a closing speech to indicate the end of the event. This was also wonderful; very different to Helen’s talk on colour theory, but just as inspiring. Kate talked about community, knowing who ‘your people’ are, as well as how we can all support each other in our creative exploits. I’ll talk more about that in yet  another  blog post – but in the meantime, check out the  Just a Card  campaign.        Kate enjoyed banging on glasses to get our attention!  Many people started packing up and leaving at the stated end time – after a cup of coffee and turning the heel on a sock, I was well prepared to spend some time sitting with other knitters and chatting until late. However, with sore feet from two days of the Knitting and Stitching Show, and a busy week ahead, I decided to do the sensible thing and go home.  I am definitely going to go to Volume 2, which will be held in one of my favourite pubs…what a wonderful new community has been created, and I am determined to become a regular member of it. I hope to see you there!  Much love,  Corrie xx        Cake! Much excitement – and two varieties!        Tea and a Muse Connection goody-bag!

Edinburgh Yarn Festival         To those of you who unfortunately can’t make it – I promise I will take hundreds of photos for you!

And I am! Isn’t that strange? Who knew this time last year that I would own things like microphones and audio editing software.  I’ve been feeling reflective for the last few days, as I’ve had a sinus infection which I caught off John just before going to Edinburgh, and I’ve spent a fair amount of time in bed, trying to catch up on reading blogs and watching podcasts. I’ll try not let the reflection get too deep…today. Additionally – it’s International Day of Happiness today! In addition to the normal parties, I’m linking with  Happy Friday  over at Planet Penny today.  I am a Podcaster  As I say, I had a big badge saying I was a podcaster last weekend. Oh my goodness, Edinburgh Yarn Festival was amazing. Really wonderful. The best bit was the people. I got to meet so many of my Twitter friends who I have ‘known’ for years, but never spoken to face-to-face. I met the podcasters, who I feel like I know and who I spend a lot of every day with as I work my way through their shows. I met people I’ve emailed about things, my ‘exhibition family’ in the form of vendors such as  Purl Alpaca  and  Belinda Harris-Reid , people who I see at every show. I spent two days with  my  people. It was glorious!  I also realised that I  am  a podcaster. You can listen  here !        The wonderful friends I made at Edinburgh Yarn Festival (photo from the pop-up studio)        A tiny selection of the podcasters I got to spend my time with.  I will record a new podcast episode when I sound less like a muppet, and all the low-down will go into that. I’m still on a high, though, and can’t wait for the next event*.  I am a Weaver  While at the Edinburgh Yarn Festival, I bought a loom. I have been thinking about making this purchase ever since Martine over at  iMake  got an Ashford Knitter’s Loom…and I was so excited about it that I proceeded to tell  everyone  that I met about it. I also told the people I had already told about it that I had bought it. Every five minutes. Sorry about that!  I ‘cast on’ a project as soon as I got back to London (please let me know what the technical term for that is?) and finished a scarf on Tuesday. It’s far too short and the tension is so funny – but I’m sure this will be another project which I frame and add to my display of “first spun yarn”, “first machine knitting” and so on.        My first ever woven scarf.  You’ll hear a lot more about weaving in the future!  I am a Knitter  There are multiple parts to this identity this week! I got so much knitting done while in Edinburgh – I finished the Angel Socks, which are currently blocked and drying and therefore un-photographed.        Working on my Angel socks with a matching teapot in Edinburgh!  I also (finally) cast on Naloa by  Renee Callahan , and am a good way through the first chart. I’ve had the yarn for this for months, the pattern for slightly less amount of time, and I’ve been promising myself I will cast on for as long as the pattern has been out. It feels wonderful to have started a brand new project that has been weighing on my mind – and I’m loving how it is turning out!  On the subject of Renee, I went to a lesson with her at  Wild and Wooly  on Wednesday night. I met some old friends there, as well as a couple of new people. We started working on Saguaro, a beautiful pattern of Renee’s, which involves two-colour cables in absolutely divine Malabrigo Rios yarn. I had a skein of “Indiecita” in my stash, and bought another of “Sunset” from Anna at WandW – the two colours are knitting up beautifully, and I am loving the new technique.        Working on my cowl during our lesson at Wild and Wooly (photo copyright Renee Callahan 2015)        A half-done cowl with Renee’s beautiful Saguaro pattern.  That’s my five things for today! They are all making me feel incredibly happy, positive, and blessed to be part of this little fibre-y community, and the misery of my sinuses have been overshadowed by the joy I’ve felt while working my way through the network I am fortunate enough to belong to.  So, have a wonderful weekend, and hopefully by next post I will be back to my normal non-reflective, brash and silly self!!  Much love,  Corrie xx   Just a quick note, sometimes at the bottom of a post you’ll see a badge linking to things like “Five on Friday”, “Wool on Sunday” and so on. These are link parties, and clicking on them will take you to other bloggers who are concentrating on that rough theme too, so that if you find you want to catch up with the world, you have a good starting point.  * The next event I will be at will be  p-Lush  in Coventry on Friday and Saturday next week. I hope to see you there!          « Previous  The Spring K&S; Show 2015: Part Four       Next »  Local Yarn(?)

I took over 300 photos, but even edited down and cut to the best, there are far too many to share in just one post, so there will be a few posts spread out over this week.  The full story of the Knitting and Stitching Show is spread over parts  one ,  two ,  three  and  four .        Entering the Spring Knitting and Stitching Show from the side-entrance (smaller queues, FYI!)  I know some of you are keen to hear about Edinburgh Yarn Festival! I’ll do a podcast later this week once I’ve got home (I’m still in Edinburgh) and make sure all the craic is recorded for future reference.  The Spring Knitting and Stitching Show  After meeting the lovely Louise at  Unravel , I offered her a bit of help on her stand for this show, which found me with an exhibitors pass at the  Sincerely Louise  stand on Friday and Saturday. It was really nice to spend some time with a designer who came to knitting in a totally different way to me. I enjoyed getting to know Louise better, as well as meeting all of the people who were enthusiastic about her book!  Louise had the book, “Faux Taxidermy Knits”, as well as all the samples to show people during the show. She also had her taxidermy heads on the walls of her stand, which stopped at least half of the people who walked past the stand. It was wonderful to be part of that, and to bask in some of Louise’s glory…having done none of the hard work!        Sincerely Louise at the Spring Knitting and Stitching Show, chatting to customers.        Louise and her wonderful frog t-shirt, which recently featured in Vogue!        A quick turn-around of the stand to mix things up on Saturday.    On Friday, I did a bit of exploring of the rest of the exhibition; particularly the individual exhibitions that had been prepared for show during the course of the weekend. Those which I took particular interest in were “The National Fashion Textiles Competition”, “The Knitted Farm” and “The Crochet Jungle”.  It was hard to miss the National Fashion Textiles Competition, as it was right in the passageway between the two main sections of the hall which the exhibition was split over. Even so, it caught my eye for sure – particularly the winning entry, which I believe my cousin would look stunning in. I wish I had the skills to translate my half-crazed mind’s eye into clothing! The exhibition was certainly inspiring.        The National Fashion Textiles Competition entries.        The winning dress, which would suit Roxy down to the ground.        The winning dress again, with another stunning design behind it.        Wrist cuffs in the fashion show.  The Knitted Farm  was obviously of interest because it was the main knitting exhibit at the show. Conceived by Sally Muir and Joanna Osbourne, the authors of “Knit Your Own Farm”, a knitted farm was arranged on a pedestal, with some of the cutest knitted farm creatures I have ever seen. All of the critters were knitted as part of a competition, and the winners were highly deserving: this turkey knitted by Deborah Ireland came first, followed by Anne Zoyroydi’s beautiful piggys, and in third place was a knitted horse with attitude by Gillian Earle.        The knitted farm in all of it’s glory.        A little field scene, complete with a proud rooster.        Geese are some of my favourite birds, this pond is adorable.        Adorable yarn-producing animals! Loving the billy goat.        More chickens, with an imposter in their midst!        The Knitted Farm winner, a majestic turkey.        A sow and her piglets, second place in the Knitted Farm competition.        This handsome fella came third. I adore the tufts at his hooves!    I lost myself in these for a little while, and nearly bought the book…but with hundreds of books in my shelves, I decided not to add another one before I’ve read some of the others…  The Crochet Jungle  is a project by one of the designers over at  TOFT Alpaca  – Kerry Lord – and aims to inspire children and adults to take up crochet by igniting their imaginations. It looked like a magical wonderland, with crocheted vines everywhere, and a giant crocheted monkey presiding over things. It was fabulous! I also wanted the Edward’s Menagerie book, but see the above comment – and the fact that I can’t crochet (yet)!        The Crochet Jungle, complete with giant monkey.               A string of monkeys from Edward’s Menagerie, a beautiful book with over 40 patterns for crochet beasties.    For the rest of the day, apart from spending time helping Louise out, I met up with Kelly, one of the volunteers from last year’s  Great London Yarn Crawl , and had a natter with her. I also spent some time with the ladies at  Purl Alpaca Designs , who have almost become family after the amount of time I’ve spent with them this year! Kari-Helene is the designer of the amazing  Icon Dress , which I wore on Friday to show off to her.        The beautiful Purl Alpaca ladies, with the Icon Dress that inspired me behind them.  Popping along to say hi to  Belinda Harris-Reid , I got her to pose next to the fabulous Strawberry Pi Shawl, which she designed and takes to every show. Just a stunning sampler shawl, this is one for which I have all of the yarn and needles, but not the courage to start yet. You’ll see it as a finished object around these parts one of these days.        Belinda Harris-Reid with her absolutely stunning design, the Strawberry Pi Shawl.        A collection of wonderful alpaca designs.        Shawl pins to buy from Belinda.        One of Belinda’s other fabulous designs, for the patriot!  Excitingly, on Saturday all of the contestants from “The Great British Sewing Bee” were wandering around the show. I wanted to go say ‘hello’, until I remembered that they are essentially also just normal people! So I left it. But I did go and say hello to Mr X Stitch, who I have really respected for a very long time.        Mr X Stitch and some of his wonderful designs.  I saw a lot more people, and will talk about specific vendors when I post my photos of them over the next couple of days (if they ever upload…) I really hope you’ve had a bit of a taste of the show anyway, and enjoyed it even if you couldn’t go. I thought the quality of the knitting vendors at the show this year was a marked step up from previous years, and I’m looking forward to seeing how the show grows.  Much love,  Corrie xx  The full story of the Knitting and Stitching Show is spread over parts  one ,  two ,  three  and  four .

You’re either breathing a sigh of relief, or unhappy about it! Never fear, there are more shows for me to review, Edinburgh Yarn Festival just the first of them.  The full story of the Knitting and Stitching Show is spread over parts  one ,  two ,  three  and  four .  The Spring Knitting and Stitching Show: Part Four  These are the final few vendors that I visited at the show. No more introduction…straight into it!  Black Bat  As a fan of wool, and especially British at that, I was excited to find out more about this company, which I had not heard about before. The company is truly inspiring; they buy fleeces off small-holders who would not otherwise be able to get their wool spun. They concentrate particularly on rare breeds, and spin the wool in limited runs.  With a huge range of different types of wool, beautiful patterns and samples of various yarns knit up, it was wonderful to see the stand. None of the yarn was dyed, which was a wonderfully refreshing sight in amidst the riot of colour that most of the other stands had.  Find out more about the company  here .        The corner of the Black Bat stall, with a wonderful range of yarns.        Samples of the yarn knitted up into beautiful scarves.        Fleece for spinning from a number of different British breeds.        More yarns, with samples below.  Cashmered  Can you say luxury? I spent a good, long time admiring the yarn of Cashmered. This is all 100% cashmere, with a range of twenty different colours, patterns and kits available to the fibre artist who wishes to indulge themself. With a well laid-out stand and a beautiful photo of goats to lure passers-by in, I kept getting drawn back to the stand as I came past it. I have added this yarn to my wish-list.  Find out more  here .        The range of Cashmered yarns.        Cashmered samples – isn’t the crocodile stitch shawl on the left stunning?        More Cashmered samples enticed me in.        Cashmere child clothes? Your tot would be so comfy!        Who doesn’t love a good picture of goats?Cas  Debonnaire  If you have ever listened to my podcast, you will know how much I adore sparkly yarn. Well, Debonnaire had it in bucketfuls. I absolutely adored walking past the stand, touching the yarn softly, and getting lost in the shimmering colours. The dyer is Erica, and she has an incredible amount of yarn available. The knitted samples looked so beautiful! I loved the colour and was very excited about the beauty and quality of the yarn.  Find out more about Debonnaire  here .        The full range of beautiful Debonnaire yarn.        Sequin yarns, a kaleidescope of colour.        The yarn, slightly more close-up.  Jennie Atkinson  I bought a lot of Kidsilk Haze in Hobbycraft once, and half of it is designated to a Jennie Atkinson design. These are vintage inspired patterns which have a delicacy that is really compelling. I first saw them at Unravel a few years ago, and ever since have admired the design that I will one day knit. It’s for a night-dress, and if you would like to find out more, you can do so  here .  Jennie was also selling her book, “A Handknit Romance”, which is just beautiful, and has a lot of projects on Ravelry.        The Jennie Atkinson dress that I will one day knit.        More of Jennie’s designs.    The Knitting Hut  I was lucky enough to do a giveaway of one of Sue Stratford’s book last year, and was excited to see her stand once again. She had a large number of knitted samples arranged around the stand, as well as a full range of books and kits. It was wonderful to see them all around, and makes me want to get my Knitted Cats and Kittens book out once again! Find out more  here .        The Knitting Hut cats and kittens.        Knitting kits in a box, with all of our most loved characters from the books.    Namolio  This was yet  another  new-to-me yarn company, and the range of gradient yarns they stocked had me stop in wonder as I tried to walk past the first time. I have never seen such beautiful balls of yarn, and I knew that I must have one of these one day (more on that another time). The company concentrates on linen and wool, as well as accessories – she had some hilarious greetings cards for knitters on the wall which were fantastic. The full range is  here .        Namolio gradient yarns.        Beautiful cards on the wall of the stand.  Rachel John  I’ve been excited by gigantic knitting in the past, and with a beam of sunlight highlighting some of Rachel’s samples, this stand was no less entrancing. I was with Kelly, a friend from the Great London Yarn Crawl, at this point, and she decided to buy a giant crochet hook to try out. It was fun looking at a number of different shapes and objects on this stand, which was almost an Aladdin’s cave. Find out more  here .        http://www.serenaanncollections.bigcartel.com/        I enjoyed this fella – no idea what it’s meant to be, but looks like a delightful face.        Samples lining the top of Rachel’s stall.        Stacks of gorgeous yarn to transform into architecture of knitting.        A wire cat! Of course.  Serena Ann Designs  This company was not on my list of people to go visit, until I got a message from someone on Twitter asking me to go. The website is here: it’s a start-up company run by Alex, who sources beautiful bags from Thailand. These bags are a wonder to behold. They are changeable, from a shoulder-bag to a back-pack, as well as big to little. A bag was my one big purchase of the weekend – in a beautiful paint splatter pattern. I will take a photo of it for you another time; for now enjoy this one of a beaming Alex, who you can find out about  here .        Alex with some of his Serena Ann Collections bags.  Tall Yarns  With a collection of clothes and yarns, I enjoyed looking at the skirts that the Tall Yarns ladies were selling. I love the style of the clothes, the text the company name is written in sings to me, and can I say I love colour again? Not only is the pattern support for the yarns absolutely incredible, but Jennie Atkinson from earlier in this post (!) has written some of her designs in their yarn. I’m in love with this company. Find the full range  here , and do not blame me if I have enabled you.        The Tall Yarns banner! Love this.        Yarns and clothes, jewel bright and wonderful.        Shawls and Scarves and Tops and Skirts….I think there’s a song in there somewhere.        Those greens are beautiful!  Watercolours and Lace  This is the last one! And the description of the company matches the yarn absolutely brilliantly. The skeins are handpainted, in beautiful soft colours that blend together gently and complement the feeing of the yarns. The weight of the yarn does not go above 4-ply, so for delicate patterns and something a bit different, this is where you must go. Find out more  here .        Watercolours and Lace yarn knitted up into samples.        Cages full of hand-painted yarns.        You can get a better idea of the colour variations here.        More yarns, with accompanying pattern support.   That’s it for the Spring Knitting and Stitching Show 2015! I hope you enjoyed the recounting of it – I’m going to breath a sigh of relief for a bit, and go do some weaving. I will delay the giveaway that I promised for today to next week – so make sure you head over on Monday to find out what you can enter for.

Enjoy yourself and feel free to contact me either using the Plutonium Muffins  form , or via email using my address, corrie[at]plutoniummuffins.com.  Knitting Aid  I was very keen to check out the knitting aid, and give it a go too. A new invention by David Hill, this is a gadget that is designed to help knitters with arthritis, by taking the weight of one’s knitting and allowing the main work to be done by the gadget. You can find out more about it  here . I did give it a go, but I wasn’t too sure about it. I suspect it would take a bit of getting used to, and I would have to learn to hold my needles in a different way to the present position.  The story behind the aid is what makes me so eager to watch what happens with it, and I am looking forward to seeing David in the future.        David Hill demonstrating use of the Knitting Aid.  Mrs Moon  This is a yarn company based in Twickenham – it used to have a bricks and mortar store, but has since become online only. At this show, they launched a new range of yarns – Plump. The yarn was wonderful and soft, and they had an incredible blanket sample knitted up which made me want to forget about budget and splurge!  I somehow missed taking a photograph of the fabulous blanket, but you can find Mrs Moon’s patterns  here . I didn’t make note of what it was called either. I will send them an email and chastise myself later.        Mrs Moon patterns and samples.        Mrs Moon’s new range of yarn, Plump.        More of the Plump, in interesting colours. Very tempting!  Natali Stewart  A new-to-me yarn and fibre company, Natali Stewart excelled in the area of silk. With a huge selection of colours and blends, roving, dyed but otherwise unprocessed locks, skeins of yarn, bricks of silk…this was a luxury fibre dream. Again, I could have bought so many things from Natali, who was lovely – you can find out more  here .  I was very eager to have a root around through a big pile of dyed Wensleydale locks (I believe), but I resisted as I knew I would not be able to resist. However, if you are a spinner and you come upon Natali’s stand at a show, have a look. You won’t regret it.        The Natali Stewart Stand with a glorious selection of yarns on the wall.        Stack of yarns and roving and felt and fabric…heaven.        A huge pile of the most delicious fibres.        Silk Bricks on the Natali Stewart stand.  Redhound for Dogs  Next up was Redhound for Dogs, a company which designs kits, patterns and accessories for dogs. They are at every show I go to, just about, and their kits are a delight. I asked if they did one for a cocker spaniel sized dog and was told that those types of dogs don’t need clothes…I beg to differ, but fair enough!  The range they design for is for small, slim-type dogs such as whippets, jack-russels and so forth. Find out more  here . If I ever decide I need to make knitwear for a dog, this is probably where I will go to find it.        The Redhound for Dogs stall with a range of kits for punters.  Sheep on Mars  There was one reason I headed for the Sheep on Mars stand – the name! Everyone knows that Plutonium Muffins is based on the idea of a muffin shop on Pluto (what do you mean you didn’t know that?!) and I wanted to say hi to my intergalactic neighbours. The added bonus was that the stand was lovely!  Natasha is a dyer with some gorgeous yarns, fibres and products to admire – I am so pleased I made a point of going over to meet her. Find her Etsy shop  here . She has not been going for very long, and has a very supportive partner who is helping her get going. I can’t wait to get some fibre from her.        Sheep on Mars with Natasha beaming at me.  The Little Knitting Company  This vendor was also, somehow, new to me. The stand was located just opposite Louise, and I spent much of the weekend admiring the displays of Soak, the wool-friendly detergent. Once I decided to go and check them out, I was delighted by the range of fuzzy yarns, stitch markers and knitting kits available. Of particular interest were the juggling ball kits!  The prices were also reasonable, in my opinion, and this is where I nearly fell down on my resolution not to buy any extra yarn. You can fall down too – go  here .        The Little Knitting Company with a corner of Soak.        Some gorgeous yarns, what a halo these would produce.        Juggling kits! I’m loving the penguins, this is what I nearly bought.        Cashmere skeins in royal colours, for a good price. I nearly did it!  Art Felt  With my new fascination for felt, I spent some time chatting to Andrea over at Art Felt, a company which produces kits for creating products using a combination of wet and dry felting. I loved this idea! Even better, Andrea is passionate about sharing ideas and knowledge, and I am excited to see how my relationship with her develops! You can find her kits  here  – be sure to check out the hedgehogs.        The Art Felt Stand, the proprietor was passionate about community and sharing of knowledge, which resonates with me.        The Art Felt stand, with flowers on the wall as a bonus.      That’s all for now! Check back tomorrow for the final instalment on the Spring Knitting and Stitching Show 2015, and on Thursday for a  fabulous  giveaway from one of my favourite fibre companies.

There’s way more information in the  original blog post  about this.        Rest in Peace, Digger.  Digger Toy  The pattern is “ Perfect Pups, Labrador Retriever ” by Alan Dart and I chose the pattern and bought the yarn the day that I found out that Digger had gone. This was part of the day when JS took me on the  fateful trip  to Mudchute City Farm. I wanted yarn that matched Digger’s colour particularly well – and  Debbie Bliss Amalfi  was the one!        Pieces for Digger. More yellow in RL.  I cast on in July 2012, managed to about half of the body, and gave up. The yarn, although lovely, doesn’t have a lot of give in it and after a few days of knitting my hands were aching! It hurt so much that I didn’t want to carry on. Fast forward a bit to May 2013, having moved to Devon, and wanting to finish up the projects in my WIP basket before I carried on casting on new things. I decided to give the yarn another go, unravelled what I had done already, and within a few weeks I had finished knitting!        Just awaiting eyes…  My first ever purchase from Etsy was the eyes for Digger, from Vietnam. I was quite desperate to finish him by this point, as you can probably imagine, and I thought that I may be able to do so within a few weeks. Unfortunately, it took two months for the eyes to reach me – by this point I had moved to London and was not around to collect them! Wonder-Mum sent them to me, they arrived two weeks ago, and within three days Digger was done.        Eyes, which caused a lot of fuss!  Sewing him up was one of the harder things I had to do. This pattern is not fantastically easy if you have not made a complex toy before – which I hadn’t. I am unhappy with the position of the fateful eyes – so much so that I am considering taking his head off and re-knitting it. I also made his eye sockets a bit dark, as well as his muzzle. What do you think?        Close up of Digger, without ears or a nose!        Digger nearly finished, enjoying the atmospheric lighting.        Digger hanging out with Skinny Liz.        Digger is complete!  While we are on the subject of dogs, check out the new member of the family, belonging to JS’ sister and husband. His name is Boris, he is absolutely gorgeous, and I have toothmarks in my hands! He makes me want one!        JS high-fiving Boris!        PUPPY        Me and puppy Boris!

I’ve already talked about the various exhibitions that I enjoyed, hanging out on the Sincerely Louise stall, as well as some of the vendors. Now for the next instalment!  The full story of the Knitting and Stitching Show is spread over parts  one , two ,  three  and  four .  The Spring Knitting and Stitching Show 2015  More vendors galore today! Grab a cup of tea, it’s a long one for your pleasure. Enjoy yourself and feel free to contact me either using the Plutonium Muffins  form , or via email using my address, corrie[at]plutoniummuffins.com.  Knitting Aid  I was very keen to check out the knitting aid, and give it a go too. A new invention by David Hill, this is a gadget that is designed to help knitters with arthritis, by taking the weight of one’s knitting and allowing the main work to be done by the gadget. You can find out more about it  here . I did give it a go, but I wasn’t too sure about it. I suspect it would take a bit of getting used to, and I would have to learn to hold my needles in a different way to the present position.  The story behind the aid is what makes me so eager to watch what happens with it, and I am looking forward to seeing David in the future.        David Hill demonstrating use of the Knitting Aid.  Mrs Moon  This is a yarn company based in Twickenham – it used to have a bricks and mortar store, but has since become online only. At this show, they launched a new range of yarns – Plump. The yarn was wonderful and soft, and they had an incredible blanket sample knitted up which made me want to forget about budget and splurge!  I somehow missed taking a photograph of the fabulous blanket, but you can find Mrs Moon’s patterns  here . I didn’t make note of what it was called either. I will send them an email and chastise myself later.        Mrs Moon patterns and samples.        Mrs Moon’s new range of yarn, Plump.        More of the Plump, in interesting colours. Very tempting!  Natali Stewart  A new-to-me yarn and fibre company, Natali Stewart excelled in the area of silk. With a huge selection of colours and blends, roving, dyed but otherwise unprocessed locks, skeins of yarn, bricks of silk…this was a luxury fibre dream. Again, I could have bought so many things from Natali, who was lovely – you can find out more  here .  I was very eager to have a root around through a big pile of dyed Wensleydale locks (I believe), but I resisted as I knew I would not be able to resist. However, if you are a spinner and you come upon Natali’s stand at a show, have a look. You won’t regret it.        The Natali Stewart Stand with a glorious selection of yarns on the wall.        Stack of yarns and roving and felt and fabric…heaven.        A huge pile of the most delicious fibres.        Silk Bricks on the Natali Stewart stand.  Redhound for Dogs  Next up was Redhound for Dogs, a company which designs kits, patterns and accessories for dogs. They are at every show I go to, just about, and their kits are a delight. I asked if they did one for a cocker spaniel sized dog and was told that those types of dogs don’t need clothes…I beg to differ, but fair enough!  The range they design for is for small, slim-type dogs such as whippets, jack-russels and so forth. Find out more  here . If I ever decide I need to make knitwear for a dog, this is probably where I will go to find it.        The Redhound for Dogs stall with a range of kits for punters.  Sheep on Mars  There was one reason I headed for the Sheep on Mars stand – the name! Everyone knows that Plutonium Muffins is based on the idea of a muffin shop on Pluto (what do you mean you didn’t know that?!) and I wanted to say hi to my intergalactic neighbours. The added bonus was that the stand was lovely!  Natasha is a dyer with some gorgeous yarns, fibres and products to admire – I am so pleased I made a point of going over to meet her. Find her Etsy shop  here . She has not been going for very long, and has a very supportive partner who is helping her get going. I can’t wait to get some fibre from her.        Sheep on Mars with Natasha beaming at me.  The Little Knitting Company  This vendor was also, somehow, new to me. The stand was located just opposite Louise, and I spent much of the weekend admiring the displays of Soak, the wool-friendly detergent. Once I decided to go and check them out, I was delighted by the range of fuzzy yarns, stitch markers and knitting kits available. Of particular interest were the juggling ball kits!  The prices were also reasonable, in my opinion, and this is where I nearly fell down on my resolution not to buy any extra yarn. You can fall down too – go  here .        The Little Knitting Company with a corner of Soak.        Some gorgeous yarns, what a halo these would produce.        Juggling kits! I’m loving the penguins, this is what I nearly bought.        Cashmere skeins in royal colours, for a good price. I nearly did it!  Art Felt  With my new fascination for felt, I spent some time chatting to Andrea over at Art Felt, a company which produces kits for creating products using a combination of wet and dry felting. I loved this idea! Even better, Andrea is passionate about sharing ideas and knowledge, and I am excited to see how my relationship with her develops! You can find her kits  here  – be sure to check out the hedgehogs.        The Art Felt Stand, the proprietor was passionate about community and sharing of knowledge, which resonates with me.        The Art Felt stand, with flowers on the wall as a bonus.      That’s all for now! Check back tomorrow for the final instalment on the Spring Knitting and Stitching Show 2015, and on Thursday for a  fabulous  giveaway from one of my favourite fibre companies.  Much love,  Corrie xx  The full story of the Knitting and Stitching Show is spread over parts  one , two ,  three  and  four .      « Previous  The Spring K&S; Show 2015: Part Two       Next »  The Spring K&S; Show 2015: Part Four        .entry-content   This entry was posted in  Blog ,  Reviews  and tagged  Art Felt ,  Knitting Aid ,  Mrs Moon ,  Natali Stewart ,  Redhound for Dogs ,  Sheep on Mars ,  Sincerely Louise ,  Spring Knitting and Stitching Show ,  The Little Knitting Co ,  The Spring Knitting and Stitching Show .

I will split my wanderings over the show into two halves, and hopefully this will make it more manageable for all involved.  If you would like to find out any further information about any of the vendors or what I got up to, please feel free to contact me on corrie[at]plutoniummuffins.com.  The full story of the Knitting and Stitching Show is spread over parts  one , two ,  three  and  four .  The Spring Knitting and Stitching Show: Part Two  Whilst spending some time on the Sincerely Louise stand, helping out Louise and generally chatting to people who found her faux taxidermy highly amusing and inspiring, I also got to go around and check out the rest of the show. There were lots of lovely vendors, some old friends and some new ones made. I was very restrained and only bought one ball of green acrylic yarn, for a quick project I promised a friend a long time ago – so no stash to talk of, but lots of interesting people to share with you.  I have already told you about Toft, Belinda Harris-Reid and Purl Alpaca, so head over to Part One to find out what they were up to.  Ann’s Orchard Beadwork  This was the neighbouring stand to Sincerely Louis, run by the fascinating Emma. With kits and supplies to make up bead pictures and works of art, I spent some time cooing over her designs. My favourite design was definitely Bob the Penguin – closely followed by Bert the Mole. You can check them all out  here .        Ann’s Orchard Beadwork, Louise’s lovely next-door neighbour.  Emma used to study the science behind potatoes, and was really interesting to talk to. Not only that, the company was so called because the land the home of Emma and her family is built on was given as part of Anne Boleyn’s dowry on the occasion of her wedding to King Henry the Eighth! I loved talking to her, and can’t wait to see what she comes up with next.  Black Sheep Wools  I did not take a lot of photos when I visited Black Sheep, but I enjoyed looking at their display for the first time this year. The bulk of their stand is generally made up of lots of yarn in a big pile – fun if you’re looking for a bargain, but I was trying not to tempt myself. I loved the colourful blankets they had pinned up around the place, and also some mugs they were selling.        The Black Sheep stand is always huge, with lots to look at.        I also loved these fluffy softies. They’re a nightmare to knit up, but you can’t beat a fluffy teddy bear!        Black Sheep Wools mugs – I wanted the one of the sheep knitting himself up, it was cute!        The Black Sheep Wool stand with a beautiful crochet blanket for our pleasure.  Black Sheep are a stalwart of big exhibitions, so if you go to a ‘large’ show, you’re bound to find them there. Otherwise, they’re also online  here .  Little Gem Knits  Next up was Little Gem Knits, an exhibitor who I was really interested in because of their felting kits. I don’t know how well you can see in the photo, but they have some fabulous landscapes with the most incredible combinations of colour! There were also a number of African scenes, which always draws my eye. The guardian of the stall was needle-felting some giraffes, which tickled me.        Little Gem Knits, with a plethora of beautiful kits, as well as finished objects for sale.        I adored this sheepy scene! Aren’t the colours beautifully blended?  Don’t be confused by the name – they deal more with felt than with knitting. Find out more  here .  international feltmakers association  Sticking with the theme of felt (can you tell I was inspired by my purchase of Jenny Barnett’s book?), I also visited the IFA to find out more about this side of the world of wool. I was just in time for a demonstration on how to make a gorgeous felted flower – something I am certainly going to have to try myself!  The chat with the ladies was inspiring, one from New Zealand who immigrated to the UK a very long time ago and got involved with the IFA as a way to stay with a community, and the other a felt-maker who has literally covered her house from top-to-bottom in glorious wool creations.        The IFA display – isn’t that coat incredible?        Another beautiful felted coat.        Time for a demonstration from one of the IFA volunteers!        Samples on the wall, showing the progression from a loosely felted leaf on green background, to the finished article.  You can find out more and join the association  here .   Although I’ve written up a lot of the other vendors, I’ve lost my steam a little for now and I’m going to head off and finish a scarf I’m knitting for a commission! (And get a cuppa, that’s important.) See you tomorrow!
