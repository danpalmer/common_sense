 Export Insurance Policy 
Proposal Form 

Please read the following information carefully 

This Proposal can be used to apply for export insurance cover for either a single export contract or multiple export 
contracts with the same buyer over a 12 month period. You must answer the questions below to the best of your 
ability. If you are unable to give a full answer to any question, please say so in your response to that question.  

We will rely on the information which you provide in this Proposal when assessing your application. It is therefore 
important that this information is correct and that you notify us promptly of any changes to it which occur before 
we issue your policy. We may avoid any policy issued on the basis of this Proposal, if the information you give us is 
not correct or if you our fail to disclose any material information to us. 

Please complete all sections legibly. Once you have completed this Proposal, please email it to us at 
tfis.underwriting@ukef.gsi.gov.uk. 

Eligibility 

We will not be able to provide you with export insurance cover for your export contract(s) unless all the following 
conditions are satisfied: 

• you must be carrying on business in the UK; 
• at least 20% of the value of your export contract(s) must represent UK content; and 
• you have approached the private insurance market and been unable to obtain the cover you require. 

Please note that we are not able to provide cover for export contracts with buyers in EU countries (except Greece) 
and certain other OECD countries where the risk period is shorter than two years. 

Combating corrupt activity 

The OECD countries, including the United Kingdom, are committed to combating corrupt activity, including 
corruption, bribery and money laundering. The law in the UK has been strengthened in order to do so.  It is your 
responsibility to comply with all laws that are relevant to your export contract(s); however, we draw your attention 
to the applicable law on bribery and on money laundering contained in the Bribery Act 2010 and in Part 7 of the 
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. In particular, certain acts committed abroad now constitute criminal offences in the UK.  

Offences by individuals under the Bribery Act 2010 are punishable on indictment by imprisonment for up to 10 
years and/or an unlimited fine. You should also be aware that we will refer any suspicious circumstances relating to 
bribery, corruption or money laundering to the appropriate authorities.

 Anti-Corruption Provisions in Existing and New EXIP Proposal Forms 

The table below shows how the anti-corruption declarations in the existing proposal form for UK Export Finance’s Export Insurance Policy (EXIP) 
have been reflected in our new form. The table identifies and explains the changes in detail. However, in brief: 

- The declarations in the new form are now better grouped and written in a more straightforward way. This has made it possible to delete 
most of the definitions that appear in the current form.   
- The declarations in the new form have been simplified by removing the exceptions to the concept of corrupt activity, such as admissions 
made under duress and convictions which have been obtained under retrospective legislation. The removal of these exceptions means 
that applicants will have to disclose all admissions of, or convictions for, corrupt activity. UK Export Finance believes that full disclosure of 
such matters is appropriate at application stage. However, it will take account of any factors covered by the current exceptions when 
considering whether to provide cover for any export contract(s).  
In the new form, applicants will have to identify all group companies involved in the export contract(s) for which insurance is requested 
(rather than making a declaration that they have made reasonable enquiries about their involvement). This should not be onerous for 
smaller exporters and this knowledge can be expected of more sophisticated exporters. 
- Now that the Bribery Act 2010 has been in force for some time, the opportunity has been taken to limit the declarations in the new form 
regarding offences under s.7 of the Bribery Act to circumstances occurring during the 5 year period ending on the date on which the 
declarations are made. This brings them in line with declarations regarding previous convictions for other offences or black-listing.

Comments 

Anti-corruption warning 

The wording has been slightly rephrased and expanded by the addition of a sentence warning 
applicants of the present criminal sanctions for corrupt activity, in line with the OECD 
Recommendation on Bribery and Officially Supported Export Credits. 
The existing wording has been reformatted so as to reduce the length of the section but there 
is no change to information requested.  Certain parts of the wording have been made more 
concise, for example, by replacing the reference to “commission, fees or other remuneration” 
by “remuneration”.  See also the comments in Row 5 on the definition of Agent. 
The questions regarding the code of conduct are substantially unchanged. Applicants without 
a code of conduct for combating corruption are now given a link to the Ministry of Justice’s 
guidance on that topic.   
To make the meaning of the question clearer, the phrase “within the last five years” has been 
moved to the end of the question. 
The definition has been shortened by having part of the old definition moved into the body of 
the question.  The information supplied in response to the question is cross-referenced in the 
declarations. 

This definition is no longer required as the concept is covered by the added question in the 
new form.  The information supplied in response to the question is then cross-referenced in 
the declarations. 
This definition is replaced by, and reflected in, the note to the ninth question in section 8 of 
the new form. 
The declarations in the new form have been simplified by removing the exceptions to the 
concept of corrupt activity for: admissions under duress; appealable convictions; and 
convictions under retrospective legislation or by a court lacking jurisdiction. Applicants will 
now have to disclose all admissions of, or convictions for, corrupt activity. UK Export Finance 
believes that full disclosure of such matters is appropriate at application stage. However, it 
will take account of any factors covered by the current exceptions when considering whether 
to provide cover for any export contract(s).

Excluded 

The requirement for the corrupt activity in question to render an export contract void, 
voidable or unenforceable has not been included because, for the purposes of the application, 
UK Export Finance would wish to know of any instance of corrupt activity so that it could be 
taken into account when considering the application.  That requirement will, however, be 
retained in the definition of corrupt activity which will be used in the clause of the EXIP which 
allows UK Export Finance to avoid the policy as a result of corrupt activity. 
The new wording does not retain the existing reference to admissions by employees acting on 
behalf of the applicant (with its authority) because an admission by such a person would 
constitute an admission by the applicant. 
See also Row 8 about admissions under duress. 
See Row 8 about competent jurisdiction, appealable decisions and convictions under 
retrospective legislation. 

The concept of a Relevant Offence is now set out in paragraph (3)(c)(i) of section 14 of the 
new form. The express reference to a court in the UK has been removed as being superfluous 
given the references to UK offences.  
See also Row 8 about appealable decisions.   
Offences in jurisdictions outside the UK are now declarable if they involve bribery or 
corruption. There is no longer a requirement for them to correspond to an offence under the 
Bribery Act 2010 or its predecessor legislation. 

The proviso to paragraph 2.4 of the existing application has been removed in line with the 
comment in Row 8 about convictions under retrospective legislation. 
The definition has been expanded to include the wording in paragraph 2.16 of section 12 of 
the current form that, in the case of a partnership, a reference to directors is to be construed 
as a reference to the partners and, additionally, in the case of a limited liability partnership, its 
members or those members appointed to manage it.  
This definition has been removed in line with the removal of the corresponding exception to 
the concept of corrupt activity: see Rows 8 and 14.

The exception for admissions made under duress has been removed for the reasons given in 
Row 8.  
The exception entitling applicants not to mention previously disclosed matters has been 
removed: applicants may easily cross-refer explicitly to disclosures made in previous 
applications.   
The language has been reordered and the express reference to the UK courts removed as this 
is superfluous given the reference to a UK criminal offence.  In addition, see Rows 8 and 22 
about admissions under duress and previously disclosed matters. 
In the new form, applicants have to identify all group companies involved in the export 
contract(s) for which insurance is requested in response to a new question in the body of the 
form, rather than making a declaration that they have made reasonable enquiries about their 
involvement. This should not be onerous for smaller exporters and this knowledge can be 
expected of more sophisticated exporters. 
The wording in the new form has been regrouped around common themes.   
The new form refers to the applicant having no reason to believe, after making reasonable 
enquiries, that the specified events have occurred but does not retain the reference to the 
applicant actually believing that fact.  The latter phrase has been removed as being an 
unnecessary complexity.  
The exceptions for admissions made under duress and previously disclosed matters have been 
removed for the reasons given in Rows 8 and 29.  
No change. 

The new wording is intended to capture the concept of acquiescence in plain English.

Related Agreement, the 
Insured shall promptly notify ECGDUK Export Finance 
accordingly and supply ECGDUK Export Finance with full details of the Corrupt Activity in

would amount to Corrupt Activity) in relation to the Contract or any Related 
Agreement; 

(2) monitor compliance with that requirement; and

Prevention of Corruption Acts have been 
replaced by the Bribery Act which is 
mentioned specifically in the definition of 
Corrupt Activity. 

Comment [l10]: The changes to the 
definition of Corrupt Activity make this 
wording unnecessary. 
Comment [l11]: UK Export Finance is

engaged in Corrupt Activity in relation to the Contract or any Related Agreement or (2) admits to 
having engaged, in Corrupt Activity in relation to the Contract or any Related Agreement other 
than where that admission is made under duress any of the matters represented and warranted in 
Clause 12.2 are untrue or incorrect or if any of the undertakings and warranties on the part of the 
Insured in Clause 12.3 are breached, ECGD: 

12.4.1 UK Export Finance  

12.4.2 

shall be discharged from any liability under this Policy and ; and

be deemed to be untrue or incorrect or any of the undertakings and warranties on the part of the 
Insured in Clause 12.3 deemed breached, if the Corrupt Activity concerned has occurred solely by

have retrospective effect.

GCSE, AS and A Level Religious Studies: Consultation on Conditions and Guidance 

About this consultation 

We are seeking views on the regulatory requirements we propose to put in place for 
new GCSEs, AS and A levels in religious studies, which are due to be taught in 
England from September 2016.  

We do not repeat the policy proposals on which we consulted during 2014 or the 
options we considered when we did so. You can find the outcome of that consultation 
on our website,1 along with a summary of the responses to the consultations and our 
equality and regulatory impact assessments.  

Awarding organisations must comply at all times with our Conditions of Recognition. 
These are the main regulatory rules that we use. We can take regulatory action 
against an awarding organisation that breaches or is likely to breach a Condition. We 
explain how the proposed subject level rules and guidance (as set out in this 
consultation) will work alongside our other regulatory tools in Appendix A. 

Further information about the reform of GCSEs, AS and A levels can be found at 
www.gov.uk/government/publications/get-the-facts-gcse-and-a-level-reform.

Summary of our proposals – GCSE religious studies 

 

 

 

New religious studies GCSEs must comply with the Department for 
Education’s subject content requirements, and with our assessment 
objectives. 

In line with our previous decisions, and with current qualifications, new 
religious studies GCSEs will be untiered, and assessed solely by 
examinations.  

In line with our approach for new geography and history GCSEs (and current 
qualifications), new religious studies GCSEs will allocate 5 per cent of the 
total marks for accurate spelling, punctuation and grammar, and the use of 
specialist terminology. 

Summary of our proposals – AS and A level religious studies 

 

 

New religious studies AS and A levels must comply with the Department for 
Education’s subject content requirements, and with our assessment 
objectives. 

In line with our previous decisions, and with current qualifications, new 
religious studies AS and A levels will be assessed solely by examinations.

1. Proposed rules and guidance for GCSE religious 
studies  

Content requirements in religious studies 

1.1 The Department for Education has published the new content for GCSE religious 
studies. Exam boards must comply with the requirements2 and with our 
assessment objectives. 

1.2 To bring this about, we propose to introduce the following Condition: 

Condition 
GCSE(Religious 
Studies)1 

GCSE(Religious 
Studies)1.1 

GCSE(Religious 
Studies)1.2 

Compliance with content requirements 

In respect of each GCSE Qualification in Religious Studies 
which it makes available, or proposes to make available, an 
awarding organisation must – 

(a) comply with the requirements relating to that 
qualification set out in the document published by the 
Secretary of State entitled ‘Religious Studies GCSE 
subject content’,3 document reference DFE-00045-2015, 

(b) have regard to any recommendations or guidelines 
relating to that qualification set out in that document, 
and 

(c) interpret that document in accordance with any 
requirements, and having regard to any guidance, 
which may be published by Ofqual and revised from 
time to time. 

In respect of each GCSE Qualification in Religious Studies 
which it makes available, or proposes to make available, an 
awarding organisation must comply with any requirements, 
and have regard to any guidance, relating to the objectives 
to be met by any assessment for that qualification which 
may be published by Ofqual and revised from time to time.

Guidance on comparability of optional routes 

1.3 The GCSE subject content for religious studies allows students to study many 
different combinations of religions and beliefs, and allows different degrees of 
emphasis on different aspects as well. It also allows for two different approaches 
to the study of religion and belief – a ‘textual studies’ approach and a ‘religious, 
philosophical and ethical studies in the modern world ’ approach. In turn, this 
means there is the potential for an unusually large number of optional routes 
through the qualification. 

1.4 Both our General Conditions of Recognition, and our GCSE Qualification Level 
Conditions, require exam boards to do all they can to ensure optional routes 
through a qualification are equally demanding. 

1.5 However, we recognise that the very large number of optional routes in this 
subject creates particular technical challenges that can make it difficult to secure 
absolute comparability across all options. 

1.6 We are therefore proposing to publish the following guidance which clarifies our 
expectations. 

Guidance on comparability of optional routes through GCSE 
Qualifications in Religious Studies 

The subject content for GCSE Qualifications (graded 9 to 1) in Religious Studies is 
set out in the Department for Education’s Religious Studies GCSE subject content,4 
document reference DFE-00045-2015 (the ‘Content Document’). 

The Content Document allows for many different combinat ions of religions, 
permitting an awarding organisation to develop a GCSE Qualification in Religious 
Studies that has a large number of optional routes through it. Ofqual is particularly 
mindful of the risks to the comparability of standards that may arise in this 
qualification as a result of this large number of permitted optional routes. 

General Condition G1.2 states that an awarding organisation must take all 
reasonable steps to ensure that the Level of Demand of an assessment for a 
qualification it makes available is consistent across all options as to tasks and 
alternative assessments which may be taken by the Learner for the purpose of the 
qualification.

GCSE, AS and A Level Religious Studies: Consultation on Conditions and Guidance 

Ofqual's GCSE (9 to 1) Qualification Level Guidance5 states, in relation to Condition 
GCSE2 (Assessment strategies), that each awarding organisation's assessment 
strategy should explain how - 

optional routes through the qualification… will be comparable in terms of 
the Level of Demand and the amount of subject content required to be 
taught and on which Learners will be assessed (D1.1, D1.2(c), G1.2). 

We expect an awarding organisation to be able to demonstrate in its assessment 
strategy for a GCSE Qualification in Religious Studies that it has taken all 
reasonable steps to ensure that it will have maximum control over comparability of 
standards between different routes at all points within the cycle of setting and 
marking assessments and awarding the qualification. In particular, this control 
should be such that smaller entry routes are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged. 

Assessment objectives 

1.7 We have previously consulted on and announced our decisions on assessment 
objectives for new religious studies GCSEs. For completeness, we set out these 
final assessment objectives below. 

Objective 

AO1 

Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of religion and belief,6 
including: 

 

 beliefs, practices and sources of authority 
influence on individuals, communities and societies 
 similarities and differences within and/or between religions and

Spelling, punctuation and grammar, and the use of specialist 
terminology 

1.8 We are proposing that 5 per cent of the marks for the assessment objectives 
should reward accurate spelling, punctuation and grammar, and the use of 
specialist terminology. This is in line with the approach we have taken for other 
humanities subjects (geography and history) at GCSE, and with current GCSEs 
in religious studies.  

1.9 To bring this about, we propose to introduce the following requirements: 

In respect of each GCSE Qualification in Religious Studies which it makes 
available, or proposes to make available, an awarding organisation must –  

(a) ensure that the total mark for the qualification consists of – 

(i) marks allocated to assessment objectives AO1 to AO2 in line 
with the weightings outlined above (the ‘subject marks’), and 

(ii) marks used to credit the accuracy of Learners’ spelling, 
punctuation and grammar and their use of specialist 
terminology, 

(b) take all reasonable steps to ensure that the number of marks 
available to credit the accuracy of Learners’ spelling, punctuation 
and grammar and their use of specialist terminology is equal to 5 per 
cent of the subject marks. 

Guidance on assessment objectives 

1.10 The draft guidance on assessment objectives (set out below) explains how we 
expect awarding organisations to interpret the assessment objectives in terms of: 

 

 

 

 

the discrete ‘strands’ within each of the assessment objectives; 

the discrete ‘elements’ within each assessment objective and its strands 
that questions and tasks could target and/or seek to credit; 

the coverage expectations, such as in relation to the different elements 
within each assessment objective and how those elements should be 
sampled over time; and 

the key areas of emphasis in each assessment objective and the particular 
meaning for the subject of any key terms and phrases used; defined terms 
are shown in bold text, followed by their definitions. 

Ofqual 2015

GCSE, AS and A Level Religious Studies: Consultation on Conditions and Guidance 

1.11 In line with the obligations set out in draft Condition GCSE(Religious Studies)1.2, 
awarding organisations must have regard to any guidance on the assessment 
objectives. For example, an awarding organisation could map how it has regard 
to the guidance as it:  

 

 

 

 

develops its sample assessment materials; 

delivers the qualification; 

develops and applies its approach to sampling the elements into which the 
assessment objectives are divided; and 

monitors the qualification to make sure it addresses all elements 
appropriately. 

1.12 The nature of the subject content in GCSE religious studies means we have 
particular concerns that assessments might focus too heavily on assessing 
superficial subject knowledge, rather than on deeper understanding of religion 
and belief. In turn, this could lead to actual, or perceived, differences in demand 
across different specifications. 

1.13 To address this issue we have considered limiting the total marks: 

 

available for questions/tasks that focus solely on rewarding recall of facts 
and other knowledge; and 

 

used to reward recall of facts and other knowledge. 

1.14 Both of these approaches would limit the extent to which questions could solely 
reward students for recalling facts they have learned. In both cases, single-mark 
questions requiring factual responses would count towards the specified limit, as 
would short-answer questions where the student simply has to recall facts to gain 
all the marks. Questions that require students to do more than just recall facts – 
for example where students need to select appropriate facts to evidence an 
argument – would not.  

1.15 Where these approaches differ is in their treatment of questions which require 
students to ‘recall and apply’ knowledge. Because the first approach focuses on 
individual questions, a single question requiring students to ‘recall and apply’ 
knowledge would not count towards the specified limit.  

1.16 The second approach, however, targets any marks that are used to reward recall 
of facts and other knowledge, including where those marks are part of a larger 
question. So any marks awarded for recall within a ‘recall and apply’ question 
would count towards the specified limit. 

Ofqual 2015 

10 

GCSE, AS and A Level Religious Studies: Consultation on Conditions and Guidance 

1.17 Although this difference is subtle, it is important. The first approach draws a 
distinction between an assessment that asks separate, linked questions requiring 
students to ‘recall’ and ‘apply’ knowledge (where the marks for recalling 
knowledge would count against the limit), and an otherwise identical assessment 
that uses single questions requiring students to ‘recall and apply’ knowledge 
(where the marks for recalling knowledge would not count against the limit). The 
second approach treats both of these assessments in the same way. 

1.18 We think that there is no material difference in demand between these two 
different ways of structuring questions. Treating them differently (which the first 
approach would do) could potentially undermine comparability, and could have 
undesirable impacts on assessment design.   

1.19 Our view is that the second approach (a limit on the total marks that reward 
recall) is less likely to compromise comparability, or to have harmful impacts on 
assessment design. It is also slightly simpler. However, we would welcome views 
on both the options we have proposed. 

1.20 We would also welcome views on what limit we should place on the proportion of 
total marks that reward recall of facts and other knowledge. Our view, as set out 
below, is that 20 per cent of total marks would be sufficient to allow awarding 
organisations to effectively sample the full range of knowledge requirements in 
the subject content.

8 Marks that ‘reward demonstrating knowledge in isolation’ means any mark awarded solely for recalling facts or other knowledge that is part of the

set out in the document published by the Secretary of 
State entitled ‘Religious Studies AS and A level subject

different approaches to the study of religion and belief. There are fewer possible 
optional routes than at GCSE, but there is still a significant number. 

2.4 We are therefore proposing to publish the following guidance, which clarifies our 
expectations for AS and A level religious studies. 

Guidance on comparability of optional routes through GCE 
Qualifications in Religious Studies 

The subject content for GCE Qualifications  in Religious Studies is set out in the 
Department for Education’s Religious Studies AS and A Level Subject Content,11 
document reference DFE-00041-2015 (the ‘Content Document’). 

The Content Document allows for many different combinations of religions , 
permitting an awarding organisation to develop a GCE Qualification in Religious 
Studies that has a large number of optional routes through it. Ofqual is particularly 
mindful of the risks to the comparability of standards that may arise in this 
qualification as a result of this large number of permitted optional routes. 

General Condition G1.2 states that an awarding organisation must take all 
reasonable steps to ensure that the Level of Demand of an assessment for a 
qualification it makes available is consistent across all options as to tasks and 
alternative assessments which may be taken by the Learner for the purpose of the 
qualification. 

Ofqual's GCE Qualification Level Guidance12 states, in relation to Condition GCE2 
(Assessment strategies), that each awarding organisation's assessment strategy 
should explain how - 

optional routes through the qualification… will be comparable in terms of 
the Level of Demand and the amount of subject content required to be 
taught and on which Learners will be assessed: (D1.1, D1.2(c), G1.2) 

We expect an awarding organisation to be able to demonstrate in its assessment 
strategy for a GCE Qualification in Religious Studies that it has taken all reasonable 
steps to ensure that it will have maximum control over comparability of standards 
between different routes at all points within the cycle of setting and marking 
assessments, and awarding the qualification. In particular, this control should be 
such that smaller entry routes are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged.

assessing superficial subject knowledge, rather than on deeper understanding of 
religion and belief. In turn, this could lead to actual, or perceived, differences in 
difficulty across different specifications. 

2.9 

In line with the approach we have proposed at GCSE, we are proposing to limit 
the proportion of total marks that are used to credit recall of facts and other 
knowledge. 

2.10 The range of knowledge requirements in the subject content is less than at 
GCSE. AS and A levels should also be more demanding than GCSEs. Our view 
is that 10 per cent of total marks is the most appropriate limit for AS and A levels, 
but we would welcome views on this point.

3.  Equality impact analysis 

Ofqual’s role, objectives and duties 

3.1 We are subject to the public sector equality duty. We have set out in Appendix 
B how this duty interacts with our statutory objectives and other duties. 

Equality impact analysis relating to proposed changes to GCSE, A 
level and AS qualifications 

3.2 We have considered the potential impact on students who share protected 
characteristics16 of the application of the principles and features that will apply 
to all new GCSE, A level and AS qualifications. Our equality impact analyses for 
our earlier consultations on GCSE,17 AS and A level18 reform are therefore of 
interest and we encourage you to read them. 

3.3 Any issues concerning the proposed content have been considered by the 
Department of Education, who have published their own equalities impact 
analysis on their subject content proposals.19 

3.4 We have also previously considered the potential impact on students who share 
protected characteristics of the policy proposals we are implementing for 
GCSE, AS and A level religious studies.20 

3.5 We do not repeat here all of the evidence we have considered, as this can be 
found in our earlier reports. We focus instead on the specific issues that arise 
from the way in which we are implementing our previous policy decisions . 

3.6 We have not identified any additional negative impacts on students who share 
protected characteristics which would result from our proposed approach to 
implementing assessment arrangements in GCSE, AS and A level religious 
studies (beyond those that we have already identified in our earlier reports). 

16 For the purposes of the public sector equality duty, the ‘protected characteristics’ are disability, 
racial group, age, religion or belief, pregnancy or maternity, sex, sexual orientation, gender 
reassignment.

3.7 During this consultation, we will continue to seek and consider evidence and 
feedback to our proposals that might help us identify any potential subject -
specific impacts on students who share a protected characteristic.  

3.8 Awarding organisations are required to consider the accessibility of their 
qualifications at the design stage and to remove any unjustifiable barriers.

Appendix A: Regulatory tools 

Comparability and innovation 

Awarding organisations operate in a market. They can design and deliver their 
qualifications in different ways, within the parameters we set. This provides some 
choice to schools or colleges, which is one of the benefits of a qualifications market. 
Awarding organisations must, however, make sure that the levels of attainment 
indicated by their qualifications are comparable to those of other awarding 
organisations’ versions of the qualifications. The awarding organisations cooperate 
in a range of ways to make sure that the standards of their respective qualifications 
are comparable. To make sure standards are maintained and comparability is 
secured, we review GCSE, A level and AS qualifications before they can be made 
available, by applying an accreditation requirement to the qualifications, and we 
oversee the awarding of GCSE, A level and AS qualifications. 

We do not wish to close down opportunities for awarding organisations to design and 
deliver their qualifications in different ways. Indeed, we have a statutory duty to have 
regard to the desirability of facilitating innovation in connection with the provision of 
regulated qualifications and a statutory objective with regard to the efficiency with 
which the qualifications market works. If we adopt a regulatory approach in which all 
aspects of a qualification are very tightly defined, we could effectively remove scope 
for awarding organisations to distinguish their qualifications from others and stop 
choice for schools or colleges. On the other hand, if awarding organisations have too 
much scope to vary their approach their qualifications might not be comparable. 

In striking a balance, we use a range of tools to regulate qualifications and the 
awarding organisations that provide them. The main regulatory tools we use for the 
qualifications in this consultation are explained below. 

Conditions of Recognition 

Awarding organisations must comply at all times with our Conditions of Recognition. 
These are the main regulatory rules that we use. We can take regulatory action 
against an awarding organisation that breaches or is likely to breach a Condition. 

There are three sets of Conditions that will apply to new GCSEs (together ‘the 
Conditions’): 

(i) 

the published General Conditions of Recognition22 that apply to all regulated 
qualifications; 

22 www.gov.uk/government/publications/general-conditions-of-recognition 

Ofqual 2015

GCSE, AS and A Level Religious Studies: Consultation on Conditions and Guidance 

(ii) GCSE (9 to 1) Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements23 that apply to 
all new GCSEs; 

(iii) GCSE Subject Level Conditions that apply to a new GCSE in a specific subject 
– we are consulting now on draft GCSE Subject Level Conditions for religious 
studies. 

There are three sets of Conditions that will apply to new A level and AS qualifications 
(together ‘the Conditions’): 

(i) 

the published General Conditions of Recognition24 that apply to all regulated 
qualifications; 

(ii) GCE Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements 25 that apply to all new A 
level and AS qualifications; 

(iii) GCE Subject Level Conditions that apply to a new A level and AS qualifications 
in a specific subject – we are consulting now on draft GCE Subject Level 
Conditions for religious studies. 

Regulatory documents 

In some Conditions we refer to published regulatory requirements. We publish these 
in regulatory documents. The Conditions require awarding organisations to comply 
with such documents. 

We are not proposing to introduce any new regulatory documents for GCSE, A level 
or AS qualifications in religious studies.  

Statutory guidance 

We publish guidance to help awarding organisations identify the types of behaviour 
or practices they could use to meet a Condition. Awarding organisations must have 
regard to such guidance, but they do not have to follow this guidance in the same 
way that they must comply with the Conditions; they are free to meet the outcomes 
of the Conditions in their own ways. An awarding organisation that decides to take a 
different approach to that set out in guidance must still be able to show that it is 
meeting the Condition or Conditions to which the guidance relates. 

We are consulting now on draft guidance for religious studies.

Appendix B: Ofqual’s role, objectives and duties 

Our statutory objectives include the qualifications standards objective, which is to 
secure that the qualifications we regulate: 

(a) give a reliable indication of knowledge, skills and understanding; and 

(b) 

indicate: 

(i) 

a consistent level of attainment (including over time) between comparable 
regulated qualifications; and 

(ii) a consistent level of attainment (but not over time) between qualifications 
we regulate and comparable qualifications (including those awarded 
outside of the UK) that we do not regulate. 

We must therefore regulate so that qualifications properly differentiate between 
students who have demonstrated that they have the knowledge, skills and 
understanding required to attain the qualification and those who have not. 

We also have a duty under the Apprenticeship, Skills, Children and Learning Act 
2009 to have regard to the reasonable requirements of relevant students, including 
those with special educational needs and disabilities, of employers and of the higher 
education sector, and to aspects of government policy when so directed by the 
Secretary of State. 

As a public body, we are subject to the public sector equality duty.26 This duty 
requires us to have due regard to the need to: 

(a) eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that 
is prohibited under the Equality Act 2010; 

(b) advance equality of opportunity between persons who share a relevant 
protected characteristic and persons who do not share it; 

(c) 

foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected 
characteristic and persons who do not share it. 

The exam boards that design, deliver and award GCSE, A level and AS 
qualifications are required by the Equality Act, among other things, to make 
reasonable adjustments for disabled people taking their qualifications, except where 
we have specified that such adjustments should not be made. 

26 Equality Act 2010, section 149. 

Ofqual 2015 

35 

                                            
 
GCSE, AS and A Level Religious Studies: Consultation on Conditions and Guidance 

When we decide whether such adjustments should not be made, we must have 
regard to: 

(a) 

the need to minimise the extent to which disabled persons are disadvantaged in 
attaining the qualification because of their disabilities; 

(b) 

the need to secure that the qualification gives a reliable indication of the 
knowledge, skills and understanding of a person upon whom it is conferred; 

(c) 

the need to maintain public confidence in the qualification. 

Legislation therefore sets out a framework within which we must operate. We are 
subject to a number of duties and we must aim to achieve a number of objectives. 
These different duties and objectives can, from time to time, conflict with each other. 
For example, if we regulate to secure that a qualification gives a reliable indication of 
a student’s knowledge, skills and understanding, a student who has not been able to 
demonstrate the required knowledge, skills and/or understanding will not be awarded 
the qualification. A person may find it more difficult, or impossible, to demonstrate 
the required knowledge, skills and/or understanding because they have a protected 
characteristic. This could put them at a disadvantage relative to others who have 
been awarded the qualification. It is not always possible for us to regulate so that we 
can both secure that qualifications give a reliable indication of knowledge, skills and 
understanding, and advance equality between people who share a protected 
characteristic and those who do not. We must review all the available evidence and 
actively consider all the available options before coming to a final, rational decision. 

Qualifications cannot be used to mitigate inequalities or unfairness in the education 
system or in society more widely than might affect, for example, students’ 
preparedness to take the qualification and the assessments within it. While a wide 
range of factors can have an impact on a student’s ability to achieve a particular 
mark in an assessment, our influence is limited to the way the qualification is 
designed and assessed. 

We require the exam boards to design qualifications to give a reliable indication of 
the knowledge, skills and understanding of those on whom they are conferred. We 
also require the exam boards to avoid, where possible, features of a qualification that 
could, without justification, make a qualification more difficult for a student to achieve 
because they have a particular protected characteristic. We require exam boards to 
monitor whether any features of their qualifications have this effect. 

In setting the overall framework within which exam boards will design, assess and 
award the reformed GCSE, A level and AS qualifications, we want to understand the 
possible impacts of the proposals on persons who share a protected characteristic. 

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are:
